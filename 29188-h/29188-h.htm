<span class = "smaller">THE</span></a><br>
PREFACE.</b></h3>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p><span class = "firstword"><b>I</b>f</span> ever preface might serve
for an apology, certainly this ought to do so. The bare title of the
book is enough to have it universally cried down, and to give the world
an ill opinion of its author; for people will not be backward to say,
that he who writes the Praise of Drunkenness, must be a drunkard by
profession; and who, by discoursing on such a subject, did nothing but
what was in his own trade, and resolved not to move out of his own
sphere, not unlike Baldwin, a&nbsp;shoe-maker’s son, (and a shoe-maker),
in the days of
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
yore, who published a treatise on the shoes of the ancients, having a
firm resolution strictly to observe this precept, <i>Ne sutor ultra
crepidam</i>.</p>

<p>To this I answer, I am very well contented, that the world should
believe me as much a drunkard, as Erasmus, who wrote The Praise of
Folly, was a fool, and weigh me in the same balance.</p>

<p>But some will say, what good can a man propose to himself in being a
panegyrist for drunkenness? To solve this difficulty I shall make use of
a comparison.</p>

<p>M. Pelisson, in his History of the French Academy, says, that Menage
did not compose that famous Requete des Dictionaires, in which he
ridicules all the academics, on account of any aversion he had to them,
but purely to
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
divert himself, and not to lose the witty turns that came into his head
upon that subject. In the same manner, I&nbsp;declare that I did not
undertake this work on account of any zeal I have for wine, you must
think, but only to divert myself, and not to lose a great many curious
remarks I have made upon this most catholic liquid.</p>

<p>It may farther be objected, that this work is so stuffed with
quotations, that they hinder the book itself from being seen; like what
I heard say of a country fellow, who complained when he left London,
that he could not see it for the houses. As an excuse for all the
others, I&nbsp;shall make use of one quotation more, and this I shall
borrow from Mr. Bayle.<a class = "tag" name = "tagP_1" id = "tagP_1"
href = "#noteP_1">1</a> “There is no room to doubt,” says he, “but some
readers will judge, that there are a little too many quotations
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
in this work, which is no less a disorder, they will say, than what
happens in some cities, where the strangers are more numerous than the
citizens. But of what importance is it to travellers, that such disorder
appears in any country, provided they find in it honest folks. There is
no reason why reading may not be compared to travelling. We should
therefore be very little concerned, whether, according to the ancient
country frugality, we are entertained with what is of its proper growth;
or if, instead of the flesh of domestic animals, and the fruits of our
own vineyards and gardens, we are served with what comes from the
market. That which really is of consequence is, that the meat be
wholesome and well dressed, and the wine good, &amp;c. <i>Unde habeat
quærat nemo, sufficit habere.</i>”</p>

<p>As to the rest, I am very far from the sentiments of a certain
writer, who having found in
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
his book <i>one</i> fault only, consulted one of his friends, whether he
should put down Errata or Erratum. For my part, I&nbsp;subscribe with
all my heart to the Errata of Benserade, and in his words frankly own,
that</p>

<span class = "subhead">
THAT ONE MUST BE MERRY.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">I</span>f</span> on one hand I have reason to fear that
the title of this book will offend the delicate ears of a great many,
and make them say, that no vice ever wanted its advocate, <i>Nullo vitio
unquam defuit advocatus</i>; I am not, perhaps, less exposed on the
other to the criticisms of as many folks, who will probably apply to me
that which was said heretofore to one in Lacedemonia, who had a mind to
make an
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
encomium on Hercules, viz. Who ever blamed Hercules?</p>

<p class = "verse">
Quis Herculem vituperavit?</p>

<p>However, though I should have no readers at all, yet am I resolved to
continue my discourse at the hazard, in some manner, of imitating Pyrrho
the philosopher, who one day, as he was haranguing the people, seeing
himself abandoned by all his auditors, pursued very magnanimously his
declamation to the end. To enter, therefore, upon the present subject,
I&nbsp;lay down this as my first position, viz. That it is lawful to get
drunk sometimes. Which I prove thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sadness is in the highest degree prejudicial to health, and causes
abundance of distempers. There is no one ignorant of this truth. Joy
(or&nbsp;mirth) on the contrary, prevents and forces them away. It is,
as the Arabians say, the flower and spirit of a brisk and lively
health<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_1" id = "tag1_1" href =
"#note1_1">1</a>. Let us run over, and examine all the different states
of life, and we shall be forced to own, that there is not one of them
all but what is
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
subject to chagrin and sadness; and, consequently, that joy, or mirth,
is most necessary to men. Which very probably the philosopher had in his
head, when he defined man a risible animal. But be that as it will, one
must certainly look upon that maxim which recommends mingling of
pleasures with the affairs of life as a very wise one.</p>

<p class = "verse">
Sometimes with mirth and pleasure lard your cares<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1_2" id = "tag1_2" href = "#note1_2">2</a>.</p>

<p>We shall confirm this precept by a beautiful passage out of Seneca,
whose writings most certainly contain no loose morality, and which is as
follows:&mdash; “The soul must not be always bent: one must sometimes
allow it a little pleasure. Socrates was not ashamed to pass the time
with children. Cato enjoyed himself in drinking plentifully, when his
mind had been too much wearied out in public affairs. Scipio knew very
well how to move that body, so much inured to wars and triumphs, without
breaking it, as some now-a-days do, with more than womanly pleasures;
but as people did in past times, who would
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
make themselves merry on their festivals, by leading a dance really
worthy men of those days, whence could ensue no reproach, when even
their very enemies had seen them dance. One must allow the mind some
recreation: it makes it more gay and peaceful. And as it is not good too
much to cultivate soil the most fertile, least, by yielding too large
crops, it may soon run to decay and ruin: so in the same manner is the
mind broken by a continued labour and application. Those who respite a
little, regain their strength. Assiduity of labour begets a languor and
bluntness of the mind: for sleep is very necessary to refresh us, and
yet he that would do nothing else but sleep night and day, would be a
dead man and no more. There is a great deal of difference between
loosening a thing, and quite unravelling it. Those who made laws have
instituted <ins class = "notation" title = "text unchanged (one word)">holydays</ins>,
to oblige people to appear at public rejoicings,
in order to mingle with their cares a necessary temperament. There have
been several very great men (as&nbsp;I have mentioned) who would set
apart certain days of the month for that end; and some others, who had
every day set hours for
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
work, and other set hours for recreation. One must therefore allow the
mind some recreation. One must allow it some repose and leisure, which
may serve for new strength and nourishment. You must sometimes walk in
the open air, that the mind may exalt itself by viewing the heavens, and
breathing the air at your ease; sometimes take the air in your chariot,
the roads and the change of the country will re-establish you in your
vigour; or you may eat and drink a little more plentifully than usual.
Sometimes one must go even as far as to get drunk; not, indeed, with an
intention to drown ourselves in wine, but to drown our cares. For wine
drives away sorrow and care, and goes and fetches them up from the
bottom of the soul. And as drunkenness cures some distempers, so, in
like manner, it is a sovereign remedy for our sorrows<a class = "tag"
name = "tag1_3" id = "tag1_3" href = "#note1_3">3</a>.”</p>

<p>It must be confessed, indeed, that properly speaking, this passage of
Seneca is levelled only against too great assiduity in labour and
business; the application, however, is very just, in relation
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
to chagrin, which causes in men’s minds a far greater alteration than
can be excited by the most rude labour either of mind or body.</p>

<p>The ancients had, besides this, another motive which induced them to
make merry, and pass their time agreeably. They considered the short
duration of their life, and for that reason endeavoured to make the best
use of it they could. It will be no difficult matter for me to prove
what I here advance.</p>

<p>Every one knows that the Egyptians made use of a very extraordinary
custom in their festivals. They shewed to every guest a skeleton: this,
according to some, was to make them think of death. Others again assure
us, “That this strange figure was made use of to a quite contrary end;
that this image of death was shewn for no other intent but to excite
them to pass away their life merrily, and to employ the few days of its
small duration to the best advantage; as having no other condition to
expect after death, but that of this frightful skeleton<a class = "tag"
name = "tag1_4" id = "tag1_4" href = "#note1_4">4</a>.”</p>

<p>This last sentiment is, without doubt, most
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
probable; for what likelihood is there that people would make
reflections the most sad and serious, at a time when they proposed only
to divert, and make themselves merry. This influence had the sight of a
skull upon the mind of Trimalchion, who Petronius<a class = "tag" name =
"tag1_5" id = "tag1_5" href = "#note1_5">5</a> tells us, thus expressed
himself on that object:&mdash; “Alas! alas! wretched that we are! what a
nothing is poor man! we shall be all like this, when Fate shall have
snatched us hence. Let us therefore rejoice, and be merry while we are
here.” The Latin is much stronger:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Heu! heu! nos miseros! quam totus homuncio nil est,</p>
<p>Sic erimus cuncti, postquam nos auferet orcus.</p>
<p>Ergo vivamus, dum licet esse, bene.</p>
</div>

<p>A little before he said almost the same thing. “Alas! wine therefore
lives longer than man, let us then sit down and drink bumpers; life and
wine are the same thing.” <i>Heu! heu! ergo diutius vivit vinum, quam
homuncio. Quare Tangomenas faciamus, vita vinum est.</i> This

puts me in mind of what Athenæus<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_6" id =
"tag1_6" href = "#note1_6">6</a> reports of an Egyptian, called
Mycernius. This man having been told by the oracle that he had but a
very short time to live, resolved to make the most of that short space,
and to that end did nothing but drink night and day.</p>

<p>This thought of an approaching death is not so importunate as is
believed, since it is, says an<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_7" id =
"tag1_7" href = "#note1_7">7</a> anonymous French author,
a&nbsp;principal beauty of an ancient hymn of the poet Cecilius. “Let me
be assured, says he, that I shall live six months, and I shall employ
them so well, as to die the seventh without any regret in the
world.”</p>

<p>The same author goes on thus:&mdash; “The moderns have not failed
imitating the elegant flights of the fine wits of the ancient Greeks and
Romans. I&nbsp;find, especially, that the Italians come nearer to them;
perhaps, because they are more proper than others to refine on pleasure.
This is the character of the nation, of the truth of which I shall give
no other proof than the last lines of an elegy, written by
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
Samazarius, a&nbsp;Neapolitan gentleman.” The sense of which in English
runs thus.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Since vig’rous youth, all blooming, brisk, and gay,</p>
<p>Excites our tender souls to sport and play,</p>
<p>Let’s taste ambrosial pleasures while we may.</p>
<p>Those joys to which our souls are most inclin’d,</p>
<p>And suit the throbbing passions of the mind.</p>
<p>Let’s love while soft ecstatic fires engage,</p>
<p>And shew us lovers on the world’s great stage,</p>
<p>Dull reason only suits with frightful age.</p>
<p>And see, she comes, for ever to destroy,</p>
<p>For ever all our bliss, and all our joy.</p>
<p>Unwelcome age comes on with swiftest pace;</p>
<p>Let’s then prevent this wretched sad disgrace.</p>
<p>O may the terrors of approaching fate,</p>
<p>Excite new fires, inspire fresh vig’rous heat;</p>
<p>That love may sov’reign reign in ev’ry part,</p>
<p>And drive unworthy weakness from our heart.</p>
<p>Thrice happy, if surpriz’d by death one day,</p>
<p>Absorpt in sweetest bliss we die away.</p>
</div>

<p>But to return to my subject. We are told for certain, that the
Scythians used to drink out of a skull; and probably they had the same
design in doing so as the Egyptians had in looking on their skeletons.
But leaving these
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
objects, which cannot be very diverting, in what view soever one may
consider them, let us come to the Romans. Gruter tells us in his
Inscriptions<a class = "tag" name = "tag1_8" id = "tag1_8" href =
"#note1_8">8</a>, that they used to cry out at their feasts,</p>

<p class = "center smallcaps">
Amici,<br>
Dum vivimus,<br>
Vivamus.</p>

<p>That is, “Friends, while we live, let us be merry.” For Raderus has
evidently made it appear, by several examples out of Catullus, Cecilius,
Varro, Anacreon, and other ancient authors, that <i>vivere</i>, or <i>to
live</i>, signifies to make merry, to give one’s self up to all kinds of
pleasures, making good cheer,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p>I know not whether the Gascogns, who pronouncing the <i>V</i>
consonant like <i>B</i>, instead of <span class =
"smallcaps">Vivis</span> <i>et regnas in secula seculorum</i>, say
(as&nbsp;I have been informed, how true it is I know not) <span class =
"smallcaps">Bibis</span> <i>et regnas in secula seculorum</i>, are of
the same sentiment with Raderus in this point: but very probably that
good honest German
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
was, who in a kind of ecstasy over a bottle cry’d out,</p>

<p class = "verse">
O felices populi, quorum <i>vivere</i> est <i>bibere</i>!</p>

<p>However, to prove this, as also at the same time to confirm what has
been said above, in relation to the motives that induced people of old
times to make merry, I&nbsp;shall instance some passages of the
ancients. But first let us not omit this inscription in Gruter<a class =
"tag" name = "tag1_9" id = "tag1_9" href = "#note1_9">9</a>, which is
not much unlike the former.</p>

<p class = "center">

<p>“Be merry, landlord, and enjoy yourself while ’tis in your power, as
for the rest, adieu.”</p>

<p>Martial says somewhere, “Be merry <ins class= "correction" title =

<p class = "verse">
Sera nimis vita est crastina, vive hodie.</p>

<p>Catullus expresses much the same sentiments in these beautiful
verses:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Horace, in several places, says how we ought (according to him) to
employ to the best advantage the little time we have to live; but
especially in one of his odes, which in English would run thus.</p>

<div class = "verse">

<p>“All things hereto invite. Come, come, away,</p>
<p>Let’s seize the present hours, nor vainly care</p>

<p>Nor are there any boon companions <i>there</i>,</p>

<p>I shall close this chapter with one of the Anacreontic odes of the

THAT WINE DRIVES AWAY SORROW AND EXCITES MIRTH.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">O</span>f</span> all the means proper to drive away
sorrow, and excite mirth in the minds of men, wine is certainly the most
agreeable and efficacious.</p>

<p>For in the first place it banishes all manner of cares, and makes us
entirely forget them, producing the same effect as the waters of the
River Lethe on those souls which were destined to enter into other
bodies.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><span class =

<p>And long oblivion.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<p>For the same reason, undoubtedly, Isidore defined drunkenness a
certain forgetfulness caused in the mind, through indulgence of
immoderate drinking. His words are these:&mdash; <i>Ebrietas est per
quam menti quædam oblivio generatur ex superfluorum potuum
indulgentia</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag2_2" id = "tag2_2" href =
"#note2_2">2</a><ins class = "notation" title = "close quote in original">.”</ins></p>

<p>A certain French poet<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_3" id = "tag2_3"
href = "#note2_3">3</a> sings thus much in the same tune:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Oui, Thirsis, <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘cest’">c’est</ins> le vin qui nous fait rejeunir,</p>
<p>Et qui bannit de nos pensees;</p>
<p>Le regret de choses <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘possees’">passees</ins>,</p>
<p>Et le crainte de l’avenir.”</p>
</div>

<div class = "verse trans">
<p>Yes, Thirsis, ’tis the vine’s prolific juice</p>
<p>Can youth and beauty re-produce,</p>
<p>Banish the sad regret of former years,</p>
<p>And of futurity the fears.</p>
</div>

<p>In the next place, wine is a sovereign remedy against a particular
species of sorrow or chagrin, I&nbsp;mean a sort of inward
wearisomeness, which the French call <i>ennui</i>. I shall explain
myself a little farther, and for my expositor I cannot make choice of a
fitter person than Mr. de St.
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
Evremont<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_4" id = "tag2_4" href =
"#note2_4">4</a>, who, after having discoursed a little on this subject,
adds, “That good cheer with one’s friends, is a sovereign remedy against
this kind of chagrin; for besides that conversation at such times
becomes more free and gay, it insensibly sweetens it. It is certain that
wine rouses up the forces of nature, and gives our soul a vigour capable
to drive away all sorts of uneasiness. I&nbsp;know very well that
certain morose people, at least externally so, and in appearance, will
shew a great deal of aversion for a remedy, the delights of which they
do not, however, too much despise. But all grimace aside. I&nbsp;don’t
trouble myself with their ill-understood severities, since the most
severe philosopher in the world has advised us to make use of this
remedy; and the most morose of our illustrious men have submitted, if we
may say so, their most austere virtues to the charms of this sweet
pleasure; and the most well-bred people have not disdained its
usage.”</p>

<p>In a word, (I must speak a little French now and then,)</p>

<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<div class = "verse">
<p><a class = "tag" name = "tag2_5" id = "tag2_5" href =
"#note2_5">5</a>Le vin fait que les annees,</p>
<p>Nous durent moins que les journees.</p>
</div>

<div class = "verse trans">
<p>Wine makes whole years to pass away,</p>
<p>And seem much shorter than one day.</p>
</div>

<p>But it does more than all this, it even assuages choler; it is an
admirable cataplasm for rage. To cite a vast number of examples to prove
this important truth would be superfluous. Amongst the many illustrious
ones I could instance, I&nbsp;shall content myself to mention that of
the Emperor Maximin<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_6" id = "tag2_6" href =
"#note2_6">6</a>, who, having been declared an enemy to the people of
Rome, by the senate, fell into such a rage and fury, that no other way
could be thought on to bring him back to his natural temper than by
making him drunk.</p>

<p>But let us return to the two principal qualities of wine, which
consist in driving away care and sorrow, and exciting mirth and joy.</p>

<p>A certain French author<a class = "tag" name = "tag2_7" id = "tag2_7"
href = "#note2_7">7</a> has a few verses on
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
this subject, which, as not <i>mal-apropos</i>, I shall here insert.
Talking of the good qualities of wine, he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Tu sais, mon cher Thirsis, qu’il a le privilege</p>
<p>D’etouffer les ennuis dont l’aigreur nous assiege.</p>
<p>Et que cette liqueur chasse de nos esprits,</p>
<p>Tous les facheux pensers dont nous sommes surpris,</p>
<p>C’est ce qui nous oblige a cherir la bouteille.”</p>
</div>

<div class = "verse trans">
<p>You know, dear Thirsis, and full well you know,</p>
<p>To wine this privilege we owe,</p>
<p>It stifles all those sad invading cares</p>
<p>Which irksome chagrin ever wears.</p>

<p class = "stanza">
This sprightful liquid makes us brisk and gay,</p>
<p>And drives effectually away</p>
<p>Those thoughts vexatious that surprise our soul,</p>
<p>And makes us cherish the full bowl.</p>
</div>

<p>Seneca, whom I have mentioned in the foregoing chapter, confirms what
has been said, “Sometimes,” says he, “one must go even so far as
drunkenness; not, indeed, that it may drown us, but drown our cares: for
drunkenness washes away care, and moves the very bottom of the soul. And
as it is a sovereign remedy
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
against some distempers, so is it a perfect cure for heaviness and <ins
class = "notation" title = "close quote missing">sorrow.</ins>
<i>Nonnunquam usque ad ebrietatem veniendum, non ut mergat nos, sed ut
deprimat curas. Eluit enim curas, et ab imo animæ movet, et ut morbis
quibusdam, ita tristitiæ medetur</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag2_8" id
= "tag2_8" href = "#note2_8">8</a>. On this account certainly it was,
Pliny maintained that Nepenthe, whose virtues Homer so much exaggerates,
was nothing in the world but generous wine.</p>

<p>Horace, in like manner, insists that wine is the only proper expeller
of the most racking cares.</p>

<div class = "verse">

<p class = "verse trans">
Nor otherwise are cank’ring cares remov’d.</p>

<p>And thus advises the sage Plancus to have recourse to this
remedy:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Sic tu sapiens finire memento</p>
<p>Tristitiam, vitæque labores</p>

<p>To lull the cares and toils of life asleep</p>
<p>With cordial juleps of old mellow wine;</p>
<p>The grand and universal anodyne.</p>
</div>

<p>In another place he thus beautifully sounds the praises of
drunkenness:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Ebrietas quid non designat? operta recludit</p>
<p>Spes jubet esse ratas: in prælia trudit inertem,</p>

<p>By her commands our hopes maturely rise,</p>

steal from the most common places? No matter. I&nbsp;have company
enough: do not all modern authors do so? However, I&nbsp;shall not, for
all that, pass over in silence what Ovid has said of this same
drunkenness. The passage is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>As I am nothing less than a poet, I shall not presume <i>to dance
with the Nine Sisters</i>, to make use of the thought of the ingenious
Sarasin. However, here follows an Ode of Anacreon, which may supply the
place of a translation of those verses of Ovid.</p>

<div class = "verse">

<p>And very probably the Greek philosopher had wine in view, when he
caused an inscription to be made over his door in these words, in
capitals, “Here are remedies for all sorts of afflictions: here are
cures for all distempers of the soul.”</p>

<p>The philosopher so often quoted by Seneca, desired no more than bread
and cheese, to rival Jupiter in happiness. For my part, though I am no
less a philosopher, yet I desire nothing to effect this but good wine.
For when I take a hearty glass, I&nbsp;find myself so much transported
with joy, that I could almost cry out
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
with that little fool in the Latin comedy<a class = "tag" name =
"tag2_10" id = "tag2_10" href = "#note2_10">10</a>, “Now could I pardon
any one that would kill me, so much afraid am I lest some accident may
trouble the purity of my happiness, and mingle some ungrateful bitter
with the exquisite sweets I now enjoy.” And, indeed, it is amongst
bottles and glasses that one may truly say,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span> “Mediis

<p>And without doubt Asclepiades had all this in his head, when he
maintained that the gods produced nothing that equalled wine in
goodness. Philostratus is much of the same sentiment, who after having
taken notice of the edict of the

THAT IT IS GOOD FOR ONE’S HEALTH TO GET DRUNK SOMETIMES.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =

necessary to health, yet it must be allowed that there are a great many
pleasures very injurious and prejudicial to it; and we should act with
precaution in using those we make choice of<a class = "tag" name =
"tag3_1" id = "tag3_1" href = "#note3_1">1</a>. But this precaution is
not necessary in those we seek in the sweet juice of the grape. So far
is drunkenness from prejudicing our health, that, on the contrary, it
highly preserves it. This is the sentiment of the most able physicians.
These worthy gentlemen are arbiters of life and death. They have over
us, <i>jus vitæ et necis</i>. We must therefore believe them.
<i>Ergo</i>, let us heartily

carouse. Every one knows that Hippocrates, the prince of physicians,
prescribes getting drunk once a month, as a thing very necessary to the
conservation of health; for, according to him, in the words of a certain
French lady&nbsp;<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_2" id = "tag3_2" href =

<p>Which baffles time, and triumphs over years,</p>

<p>“Avicenna and Rasis, most excellent physicians of Arabia, say<a class

is a thing very salutary and wholesome to get drunk sometimes.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<p>Monsieur Hofman confirms what has been just now said in relation to
Avicenna, and adds thereto the testimony of another physician.
“Avicenna,” says he<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_4" id = "tag3_4" href =
"#note3_4">4</a>, “absolutely approves getting drunk once or twice every
month, and alleges for it physical reasons.”&mdash;Dioscorides says,
“That drunkenness is not always hurtful, but that very often it is
necessary for the conservation of health.”&mdash;Homer says, “That
Nestor, who lived so long, tossed off huge bocals of wine<a class =
"tag" name = "tag3_5" id = "tag3_5" href = "#note3_5">5</a>.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Hofman believes also, that wine is an excellent preservative
against distempers, and of an admirable use in their cure. In like
manner, several divines believe, that there is no manner of harm in
getting drunk, when it is done for health’s sake and not for pleasure.
In this class one may reckon Pere Taverne, a&nbsp;Jesuit<a class = "tag"
name = "tag3_6" id = "tag3_6" href = "#note3_6">6</a>. These are his
words: “Drunkenness,” says he, “is a mortal sin, if one falls into it
for pleasure only; but if one gets drunk for any
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
honest end, as for example, by direction of one’s physician in order to
recover health, there is no manner of harm in it at all.”</p>

<p>But, however, not to digress too much from our subject, to preserve
their health the Africans drink a great deal of wine; and this they do
to help the digestion of the vast quantity of fruits they eat.</p>

<p>Montaigne<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_7" id = "tag3_7" href = "#note3_7">7</a>
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘tell’">tells</ins>
us, that he heard Silvius, an excellent physician of
Paris, say, <ins class = "notation" title = "open quote in original">“That</ins>
to keep up the powers of the stomach, that they
faint not, it would be very proper to rouze them up once a month by this
wholesome excess. And if we believe Regnier, a&nbsp;young physician does
not see so far as an old drunkard<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_8" id =
"tag3_8" href = "#note3_8">8</a>.</p>

<p>We also say with the French poet<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_9" id =

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Si Bourdaloue<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_10" id = "tag3_10" href =

</div>

<p>And, by the bye, if the number of physicians, who used to get drunk,
proves any thing, I&nbsp;could insert a good round catalogue, amongst
whom I do not find any English doctors, for they are the most abstemious
persons in the world; however, being unwilling to trouble my gentle
reader with so long a bead-roll, I&nbsp;shall instance only two very
illustrious topers of the faculty. The first is no less a man than the
great Paracelsus, who used to get drunk very often; and the other is the
famous master Dr. Francis Rabelais, who took a singular pleasure to
moisten his clay; or to make use of one of his own expressions, <i>Humer
le piot</i>.</p>

<p>I could, after these, mention Patin<a class = "tag" name = "tag3_11"
id = "tag3_11" href = "#note3_11">11</a>, who tells us, That when he
gave his public entertainment for his <i>decanat</i>, or deanship, at
which thirty-six of his colleagues assisted, he never saw in all his
life so much toping. From all which,
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
however, one may very reasonably infer, that so many able persons would
never have drunk so much, had they not thought it was no ways
prejudicial to their health.</p>

<p>To conclude, let any one allege this verse as a maxim, that</p>

<p>And is not the reason plain? because it moistens their dry
temperament, and nourishes their radical moisture. Hence came the
proverb, which says, “That wine is the milk of old men<a class = "tag"
name = "tag4_2" id = "tag4_2" href = "#note4_2">2</a>.”
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
Tirellus, in his history, declares the same thing, when he says, “That
wine is the nutriment of natural heat<a class = "tag" name = "tag4_3" id
= "tag4_3" href = "#note4_3">3</a>.” Conformably to this truth that old
man acted, of whom Seneca makes mention, who being pressed to drink wine
cooled in snow, said, “That his age made him cold enough, and that he
did not desire to be more cold than he was<a class = "tag" name =
"tag4_4" id = "tag4_4" href = "#note4_4">4</a>.” Than which, certainly
no answer could be more just and true.</p>

<p>Besides, the infirmities of an advanced age require some consolation
and diversion. Let us see what Montaigne says, who was not much given to
tippling; for he plainly says, that his gout and complexion were greater
enemies to drunkenness than his discourse. His words are these, “The
inconveniencies attending old age, which stand in need of some support
and refreshment, might with reason produce in me a desire of this
faculty, since it is as it were the last pleasure that the course of
years steals from us. The natural heat, say the boon companions, begins
first at the feet; this is the case of infancy; thence it
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
ascends to the middle region, where it continues a long while, and there
produces in my mind the only true pleasures of the corporal life; at
last exhaling itself like a vapour, it moves upwards, till it comes to
the throat, and there it makes its last little stay<a class = "tag" name
= "tag4_5" id = "tag4_5" href = "#note4_5">5</a>.”</p>

<p>Athenæus, after Theophrastus, says, That wine drives away those
irksome inquietudes to which old people are unhappily subject<a class =
"tag" name = "tag4_6" id = "tag4_6" href = "#note4_6">6</a>. And to
conclude, the divine Plato assures us, that, “Wine is a medicine as well
for the body as the mind, the dryness of old people have great occasion
for this kind of moistening, and their severe genius of the brisk gaiety
inspired by wine, without which they would not be able to perform their
part in the concert, and consequently would be no longer useful members
in the commonwealth, which is no other ways supported and preserved than
by harmony.”</p>

THAT WINE CREATES WIT.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">A</span>s</span> wine increases the quantity of animal
spirits, by the fumes which it sends to the brain, it is easy to
comprehend that it cannot but be of great advantage to dull and heavy
wits; so that one may particularly apply to them the common proverb,
“Wine sets an edge to wit<a class = "tag" name = "tag5_1" id = "tag5_1"
href = "#note5_1">1</a>.” And the emblem of Adr. Junius, in which he
represents Bacchus as a youth with wings on, and with this inscription,
“Wine kindles wit<a class = "tag" name = "tag5_2" id = "tag5_2" href =
"#note5_2">2</a>,” agrees admirably well with these people. But the
application of both proverb and emblem is no less just in relation to
all the world; for it is most certain, that the god Bacchus, by warming
the thoughts, renders them more acute, and inspires a greater plenty of
witty
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
sallies. For “Bacchus had not the name of Lysian, or Opener, if I may
use the term, bestowed upon him for nothing but purely because he opens
the mind, by putting it into an agreeable humour, and renders it more
subtile and judicious<a class = "tag" name = "tag5_3" id = "tag5_3" href
= "#note5_3">3</a>.” For this reason it is grown into a proverb, That
water-drinkers are not near so knowing as those who drink wine<a class =
"tag" name = "tag5_4" id = "tag5_4" href = "#note5_4">4</a>.</p>

<p>Plutarch assures us, That wine collects and increases the powers of
the mind. He observes also, That it produces excellent effects on the
minds of persons, who, though naturally timid, want no penetration.
Plato maintains, as I have observed in the foregoing chapter, That wine
warms as well the mind as the body. Monsieur Hofman says a great deal
more, viz. <ins class = "notation" title = "open quote here in 1723 edition">That</ins>
experience proves, that those climates which produce
good wine, produce also people that <ins class = "notation" title =
"open quote unchanged">“have</ins> infinitely more wit than those of the
north, who drink nothing but beer. Gryllus believes, That the Greeks
were called fathers
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
of wisdom, on account of the excellency of their wine; and, that they
lost their ancient lustre by reason of the Turks rooting out their
vines. The Heathens placed Pallas and Bacchus in the same temple, to
shew, that wine increased their wisdom, and that the Gods were
represented wiser than men, only because they drank nectar and
ambrosia.”</p>

<p>In respect of poets the world was always so sensible of the necessity
they lay under, of having their imagination roused by wine, that nobody
ever had any good opinion of the productions of a poet that drank water,
that <i>Non est Dythyrambus si aquam bibat</i>; and wine was called the
poets great horse. “There never were any excellent poets,” says Mr.
Bayle, “that could versify, till after drinking pretty plentifully<a

<p>Let us make a few commentaries on this verse of Horace.</p>

<p>We read, that “the sages of Portugal having undertaken to convert
those of Melinda, gained as much upon them by wine as by reason, which,
in the end, facilitated the conquest of the whole country<a class =
"tag" name = "tag6_1" id = "tag6_1" href = "#note6_1">1</a>.”</p>

<p>To draw a consequence from this, we say, That one must reasonably
believe, that wine
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
gave those sages an eloquence necessary to convert the people of
Melinda, and them a necessary penetration to discover the truth through
the thick veils of their ignorance.</p>

<p>Books of travels farther inform us, that “the priests of the kingdom
of Tibet, whom they call Lamas, drink a good quantity of wine on their
days of fasting and devotion, that they may have, to use their own
words, the tongue prompt and ready to say their orisons<a class = "tag"
name = "tag6_2" id = "tag6_2" href = "#note6_2">2</a>.”</p>

<p>According to this doctrine, Palingenius was much in the wrong to say,
that wine makes churchmen uncapable to perform the duties of their
function.</p>

<p class = "verse">

<div class = "verse trans">

<p>Surely our author never conversed much with the religious. The <ins

told him, they never perform their office without taking a
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
choir cup. Experto crede Roberto, as the saying is. There is no false
Latin in this, says a good monk to me once upon a time, drawing from
under his cassock a double flask. You are much in the right on’t,
brother Peter, said I, I&nbsp;believe as the church believes, and
so&mdash;my service to you, and here’s to the pious memory of St.
Boniface. And indeed the vehicle proved capaciously orthodox.</p>

<p>In relation to what hath been said I shall add a remark of the famous
M.&nbsp;Bayle. “It cannot be denied,” says he, “that the christians of
Europe are subject to two great vices, drunkenness and lewdness. The
first of these reigns in cold countries, the other in hot. Bacchus and
Venus share these two climates between them. We find that the
reformation having divided this portion of christianity, that part which
was subject to Venus continues as it was, but the greatest part of what
was subject to Bacchus has renounced popery<a class = "tag" name =
"tag6_4" id = "tag6_4" href = "#note6_4">4</a>.”</p>

<p>But you will say, what coherence has this remark with the matter in
question? Have a little
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
patience, and you shall presently see the application. I&nbsp;say then,
that a thorough true blue hearty Protestant would conclude from this
quotation, that wine bestowed so much eloquence and penetration to these
northern people, as to put them into that happy state, to discover the
truth, and conquer all prejudices against it whatsoever. But of this
enough.</p>

<p>Daily experience teaches us, that one of the best means to push one’s

<p>But what is more, wine does the office of a mediator between enemies.
Of which truth I shall instance two illustrious examples,
M.&nbsp;Crassus reconciled himself to Cicero at a feast; Asdrubal and
Scipio did the same on the like occasion. And one may see, in a
description which a very learned person<a class = "tag" name = "tag7_3"
id = "tag7_3" href = "#note7_3">3</a> has given of Switzerland, that
when the inhabitants of that country quarrel with one another, and come
to blows, they are
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
immediately reconciled, by returning to their cups, and no harm ensues,
but sitting up all night, and amicably getting drunk together. The Latin
has more force in it, which I shall therefore here transcribe. <i>Quin
et si quando vehementius in se insurgunt, depositis in medium armis,
pugnis rem manibusque decernunt, sed eodem momento conveniunt, iisdemque

<p>Tacitus had said the same thing long before of the Germans.</p>

<p>But to come nearer. The bishop of Bitonto, one of the fathers of the
Council of Trent, and a famous preacher, frequently in his sermons,
exhorting the Germans to unity, and to return to the church, made use of
this topic of friendly drinking, conjuring them thereto as undoubtedly,
by the strongest, and most efficacious argument he could make use of, by
remembering how merry and sociable heretofore they had been in their
cups.</p>

THAT THE CUSTOM OF GETTING DRUNK IS MOST ANCIENT.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">A</span>fter</span> having displayed the good qualities of
wine and drunkenness, I&nbsp;come now to shew, that it is generally
received by all the world. To do this effectually I shall enter into
some particular detail, and after having remarked, <i>en passant</i>,
how the custom of fuddling is very ancient, I&nbsp;shall then shew, that
the primitive christians used to get drunk: I&nbsp;shall speak something
of the tippling of churchmen in general, afterwards I shall take a
cursory review of popes, saints, and bishops, then I shall come to kings
and emperors, and give a small catalogue of these illustrious topers;
I&nbsp;shall not forget the philosophers, and much less the poets, who
loved drinking. Freemasons, and other learned men, who
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
after having wearied themselves with important studies have taken this
diversion, shall also appear upon the stage. After this I shall
enumerate the several nations that have been, and those which yet are
subject to get fuddled; whether they make use of wine for that purpose,
or such liquors as produce the same effect with wine. And from this
enumeration I shall draw some consequences in favour of drunkenness.</p>

<p>But before I enter into this detail, I hope I shall be permitted a
general remark, which is, that my readers must not expect I should set
down a complete list of all the several sorts of topers I just now
mentioned; such an exactitude would take up too much time. Much sooner
may one reckon up what numbers die away every spring by the doctor; and
how many dispose of their maidenheads before marriage.</p>

<p>In every different class you will find no other jolly drinkers, but
such as I have met with in my great reading, and as shall occur to my
remembrance. Neither shall I be very scrupulous in placing them
according to the strict rules of chronology, but put them down as they
present themselves to my imagination.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<p>If the antiquity of a custom makes it always good and laudable,
certainly drunkenness can never deserve sufficient recommendation. Every
one knows, that Noah got drunk after he had planted the vine. There are
some who pretend to excuse him, that he was not acquainted with the
strength of wine. But to this it may very well be answered, that it is
not very probable so wise a man as Noah should plant a vine without
knowing its nature and property. Besides, it is one thing to know,
whether he got drunk at all: and another, whether he had an intention to
do&nbsp;so.</p>

<p>But if we give any credit to several learned persons, Noah was not
the first man that got fuddled. Father Frassen maintains, “That people
fed on flesh before the flood, and drank wine. There is no likelihood,
according to him, that men contented themselves with drinking water for
fifteen or sixteen hundred years together. It is much more credible,
that they prepared a drink more nourishing and palatable. These first
men of the world were endued with no less share of wit than their
posterity, and, consequently, wanted
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
no industry to invent every thing that might contribute to make them
pass their lives agreeably. Jesus Christ says, that in the days of Noah,
before the Flood, men married, and gave their children in marriage.
These people, Father Frassen observes, regaled each other, and made
solemn entertainments. Now who can imagine, that they drank at those
festivals nothing but water, and fed only on fruits and herbs! Noah,
therefore, was not the inventor of that use which we make of the grape;
the most that he did, was only to plant new vines<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_1" id = "tag8_1" href = "#note8_1">1</a>.”</p>

<p>This good father was not singular in his opinion; another very
learned person also believed, that from the passage of Scripture above
cited, one might draw a very probable argument, that men before the
flood drank wine, and that too even to be drunk<a class = "tag" name =
"tag8_2" id = "tag8_2" href = "#note8_2">2</a>.</p>

<p>As for Procopius of Gaza<a class = "tag" name = "tag8_3" id =
"tag8_3" href = "#note8_3">3</a>, one of the most ancient interpreters
of Scripture, he thinks it no
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
less true, that the vine was known in the world before Noah’s time, but
he does not allow that the use of wine was known before that patriarch,
whom he believes to be the inventor of&nbsp;it.</p>

THAT THE PRIMITIVE CHRISTIANS GOT DRUNK.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">T</span>here</span> is no one that has ever so little
dipped into ecclesiastical history, but knows very well, that in the
primitive church it was a custom to appoint solemn feasts on the
festivals of martyrs. This appears by the harangue of Constantine, and
from the works of St. Gregory Nazianzen, and St. Chrysostom. People
generally got drunk at these feasts; and this excess was looked upon as
a thing that might be permitted. This evidently appears by the pathetic
complaints of St. Augustin and St. Cyprian: the former of these holy
fathers expresses himself after this manner:<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
“Drunken debauches pass as permitted amongst us, so that people turn
them into solemn feasts, to honour the memory of the martyrs; and that
not only on those days which are particularly consecrated to them,
(which would be a deplorable abuse to those, who look at these things
with other eyes than those of the flesh,) but on every day of the year<a
class = "tag" name = "tag9_1" id = "tag9_1" href =
"#note9_1">1</a>.”</p>

<p>St. Cyprian, in a treatise attributed to him, says much the same
thing. “Drunkenness, says he, is so common with us in Africa, that it
scarce passes for a crime. And do we not see Christians forcing one
another to get drunk, to celebrate the memory of the martyrs<a class =
"tag" name = "tag9_2" id = "tag9_2" href = "#note9_2">2</a>!”</p>

<p>But it was not only at these repasts that the Christians got drunk,
they did the same on several other occasions; and it was on this account
that St. Augustin wrote to his dear Alipius in these terms: “However the
corruption of manners, and the unhappiness of the times, have induced us
to wish, I&nbsp;do not say that people should not get drunk in
particular houses, but
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
that they should not get drunk any where else<a class = "tag" name =
"tag9_3" id = "tag9_3" href = "#note9_3">3</a>.”</p>

<p>Cardinal du Perron tells us, “That the Manichæans said, that the
Catholicks were people much given to wine, but that they never drank
any<a class = "tag" name = "tag9_4" id = "tag9_4" href =
"#note9_4">4</a>.”</p>

<p>Against this charge St. Augustin no otherwise defends them, than by
recrimination. He answers, “That it was true, but that they (the
Manichæans) drank the juice of apples, which was more delicious than all
the wines and liquors in the world. And so does Tertullian, which liquor
pressed from apples, he says, was most strong and vinous.” His words
are, <i>Succum ex pomis vinosissimum</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag9_5"
id = "tag9_5" href = "#note9_5">5</a>.</p>

<p>Here one may observe also, that the use of cider was very primitive
and antient, but as strong and delicious as it was, the Catholicks stuck
close to the juice of the grape, as what was entirely orthodox and no
wise conversant with the heretics of those days.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<p>But to return to these feasts just now mentioned, it is certain, that
it was not only customary for the Christians of Africa to get drunk.
They had this custom in common with the Christians of Italy, where these
kinds of repasts were forbidden by the Council of Laodicea, which was
held in the fourth century. Paulinus, however, (and I do not wonder at

Churchmen’s lives by their discourses, certainly one would take them for

<p>If the law of prescription take place, one cannot dispute with them
that of fuddling with any colour of reason, for in St. Jerom’s time, the
priests were very much given to wine. This we learn from an epistle of
that father, in which he very severely reprehends them. They have
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
been no changelings since. We read in the adages of Erasmus, that it was
a proverb amongst the Germans, that the lives of the monks consisted in
nothing but eating, drinking, and<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Monachorum nunc nihil aliud est quam facere,
esse, bibere. Besides, a&nbsp;vast number of councils, who made most
severe canons against priests that should get drunk, evidently shew,
that they used frequently to do so. Such were the Councils of Carthage,
Agathon, the first of Tours, that of Worms, Treves, &amp;c. To make this
more clear, we shall copy a little of what H.&nbsp;Stephens says on this
subject, in his apology for Herodotus:&mdash; “But to return, says he,
to these proverbs, theologal wine, and the abbots, or prelates table.
I&nbsp;say, that without these, one could never rightly understand this
beautiful passage of Horace, viz.</p>

</div>

<p>“You see how necessary these proverbs are, to let us into the true
understanding of these two passages of this poet. Here follows, word for
word, what a certain gloss says of the last of them, <i>Mero dicit
potiore (meliore) cænis pontificum, quam quo pontifices in cænis suis,
quæ semper sumtuosissimæ fuerunt, unde nunc theologicum dicunt vinum,
usi sunt</i>. That is, with better wine than that which the chief
priests
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
used at their suppers, which were always most sumptuous and expensive,
and which sort of wine we call now theological.</p>

<p>“By this you plainly see how much attached to divines and prelates
those gentlemen are who make profession of being expositors of the
poets. But in relation to this same theologal, or theological,
I&nbsp;know very well that it is a great question if it should be called
<i>vinum theologale</i>, or <i>vinum theologalis per appositionem</i>;
for the wicked laity, some of them will have it, that when these good
men get tipsy they agree no otherwise than dogs and cats. But I shall
leave this dispute to be decided by the readers. And as to these two
proverbs, they put me in mind of another, and that is, an abbot’s face,
which proverb being very ancient, makes me believe that formerly the
abbots had their faces illuminated.&mdash;But without going any farther
for witnesses, I&nbsp;shall content myself with presenting my readers
with the following piece of antiquity, viz.</p>

needless, to put the whole in the clearest light, to confirm what has

practised that laudable custom of getting drunk.</p>

<p>A little song, mentioned by H. Stephens, in <ins class = "correction"

matter of speculation in relation to the sobriety of sovereign
pontiffs.</p>

<div class = "verse">

<p>The Pope at Rome, his holiness,</p>

<p>As any other man I trow.</p>
</div>

<p>If one reads over the popes lives, we shall be fully convinced that
these holy fathers were no enemies to wine. Alexander the Fifth was a
great drinker, and that too of strong wines, says his own historian,
Theoderic de Neim. If one may give any credit to the letters of the king
of Spain’s ambassador to his master, Sixtus Quintus was a terrible
drunkard<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_1" id = "tag11_1" href =
"#note11_1">1</a>.</p>

<p>And Pope Boniface instituted indulgencies for those who should drink
a cup after grace (called since St. Boniface’s cup). A&nbsp;plain
argument that his sanctity did not hate wine.</p>

<p>This puts me in my mind of what I have formerly read, though the
author’s name is now slipped out of my memory, that when cardinal
Pignatelli, afterwards Innocent the Twelfth, was advanced to the papacy,
his name signifying little pots or mugs, three of which he bore for his
<span class = "pagenum">69</span>
arms; and whose mother was of the house of Caraffa, which signifies a
jug, a&nbsp;Frenchman made these lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the main, this is nothing but a little punning or playing with
words, but it is one of those agreeable trifles that may now and then be
worth our thinking&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>One may add to the number of such popes as loved fuddling, all those
who sat at Avignon;
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
for if we believe Petrarch<a class = "tag" name = "tag11_2" id =
"tag11_2" href = "#note11_2">2</a>, the long residence that the court of
Rome made at Avignon, was only to taste the good French wines; and that
it was merely on that account they stayed so long in Provence, and
removed with so much reluctance.</p>

<p>Let us now pass on to Saints and Bishops. I&nbsp;shall only instance
one of each, because I hate prolixity. The first Saint that presents
himself to me, is the renowned St. Augustin, who himself owns, that he
used to get drunk sometimes. <i>Crapula autem nonnunquam surrepit servo
tuo misereberis ut longe fiat à me.</i> Thy servant has been sometimes
crop-sick through excess of wine, have mercy on me, that it may be ever
far from me. It is true, <a class = "tag" name = "tag11_3" id =
"tag11_3" href = "#note11_3">3</a>M.&nbsp;Cousin maintains against my
author, M.&nbsp;Petit, the Journal des Sçavans, of the year 1689, 27th
June, that St. Augustin, however, never got drunk. The arguments on both
sides you may find in Bayle’s Dictionary, under the article Augustin.
But
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
yet there are somewhere in St. Augustin these words, viz. My soul
certainly being a spirit cannot dwell in a dry place. <i>Anima mea certè
quia spiritus est, in sicco habitare non potest.</i></p>

<p>I shall make no comment upon these words, only insert one already
made, which I take from M.&nbsp;Duchat in his Remarks on Rabelais<a
class = "tag" name = "tag11_4" id = "tag11_4" href = "#note11_4">4</a>.
On these words of Saint Augustin, says he, mentioned in the second part
of the Decretals, caus. 32, q.&nbsp;2, c.&nbsp;9, the commentator says,
“And this is an argument for the Normans, English, and Poles, that they
may drink largely, that the soul may not live in the dry. <i>Et est
argumentum pro Normannis, Anglicis, et Polonis, ut possint fortiter
bibere, ne anima habitet in <ins class = "notation" title = "close quote missing">sicco.</ins></i>
To which Peter Chatelain, a&nbsp;Flemish
physician, made this pleasant addition, <ins class = "notation" title =
"open quote missing">It</ins> is very probable, that the commentator was
an entire stranger to the nature of the Flemings. <i>Verisimile est
glossatorem ignorasse naturam Belgarum.</i>”</p>

<p>And, perhaps, this argument from St. Augustine’s words, is as just as
one of a merry fellow
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>
I knew, who would prove, from St. Paul’s going to the Three Taverns<a
class = "tag" name = "tag11_5" id = "tag11_5" href = "#note11_5">5</a>,
That he loved a hearty bottle.</p>

<p>Amongst the Bishops, I cannot instance a more illustrious example of
a great drinker than that of Pontus de Thiard. We are told<a class =
"tag" name = "tag11_6" id = "tag11_6" href = "#note11_6">6</a>, “That
this gentleman, after having repented of the sins of his youth, came to
be bishop of Chalons sur Soane; but, however, he did not renounce the
power of drinking heartily, which seemed then inseparable from the
quality of a good poet. He had a stomach big enough to empty the largest
cellar; and the best wines of Burgundy were too gross for the subtility
of the fire which devoured him. Every night, at going to bed, besides
the ordinary doses of the day, in which he would not suffer the least
drop of water, he used to drink a bottle before he slept. He enjoyed a
strong, robust, and vigorous health; to the age of fourscore<ins class =

<p>Cæsar, to make use of Balzac’s words, was not always the sober

pleasure of drinking.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<p>Cambyses was also very much given to wine, as may be judged by what I
am going to say. This prince, having been told by one of his courtiers,
That the people took notice he got drunk too often, taking, some time
after, his bow and arrow, shot the son of that courtier through the
heart, saying no more than this to the father, Is this the act of a
drunkard?</p>

<p>Darius, the first king of Persia, had these words put upon his
tomb:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
Vinum multum bibere potui idque perferre.</p>

<p class = "verse trans">
I could drink much wine and bear it well.</p>

<p>King Antigonus may come in here. Ælian reports of this prince, That
one day when he was much in drink, meeting Zeno the philosopher, whom he
had a great kindness for, he kissed him, and promised to give him
whatever he would desire. Zeno only answered very mildly, Go and ease
your stomach by vomiting, that’s all I ask of you at present.</p>

<p>Philip, king of Macedon, got drunk sometimes; witness what a woman,
whom he had not done

justice to, said to him, viz. I&nbsp;appeal from Philip drunk, to Philip

<p>Dionysius<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_5" id = "tag12_5" href =
"#note12_5">5</a> the younger, tyrant of Sicily, was sometimes drunk for
nine days successively; he drank himself almost blind, and the lords of
his court, to flatter him, pretended they themselves could scarce see,
so that they neither eat nor drank but what he reached to them.</p>

<p>Tiberius was called Biberius, because of his excessive attachment to
drinking; and, in derision, they changed his surname of Nero into
Mero.</p>

<p>Bonosus was a terrible drinker, if one may give any credit to his own
historian, Flavius Vopiscus. He used to make ambassadors, that came to
him from foreign powers, drunk, in order, by that means, to discover
their secret instructions.</p>

<p>Maximin<a class = "tag" name = "tag12_6" id = "tag12_6" href =

<p>Trajan and Nerva, those excellent princes, took sometimes a pleasure
in getting drunk.</p>

<p>Galerius Maximinus, who, according to Aurelius Victor, was a prince
of sweet temper, and loved men of probity and letters, had a very great
passion for wine, and frequently got drunk. Having once given orders
when he was in this condition, which he repented of when sober, he
solemnly forbad any one to obey such orders that he should give when he
should get drunk for the future.</p>

</div>

<p>It is, however, very true, that we shall find ourselves wonderfully
disposed to get fuddled, when we consider that those of antiquity, for
whom we have most respect and veneration, have made no manner of
difficulty to get drunk sometimes, and have praised drunkenness not only
by their actions but discourse. This I am going plainly to make appear.
I&nbsp;begin with the Seven Sages of Greece, who were acknowledged as
such by all antiquity. These philosophers did not look upon drunkenness
as a thing incompatible with virtue, of which they made strict
profession. History tells us, that they drank largely at the
entertainment Periander the Tyrant, or king of Corinth, gave them.</p>

<p>Solon, that famous, yet so rigid, legislator of the Athenians,
composed a song in the praise of wine, in which he introduced Venus and
the Muses. Seneca is of opinion, that he was suspected to be as much
given to wine as Arcesilaus. And M.&nbsp;Chevreau<a class = "tag" name =
"tag13_1" id = "tag13_1" href = "#note13_1">1</a> observes very well,
that “The
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
wisdom of Solon was not of such an austerity as to frighten people, when
he said, That the ladies, wine, and the Muses, were the pleasures of
human life.”</p>

<p>Zeno, whose philosophy was so severe, got, notwithstanding, drunk
sometimes. Being one day at an entertainment, he was asked how he came
to be so joyful, he answered, that he was like lupins, which were bitter
naturally, but grew sweet after they were moistened.</p>

<p>Socrates, whom the oracle declared the wisest man of Greece, was, in
like manner, a&nbsp;very great drinker. M.&nbsp;Charpentier, in his
Life, tells us, That though he did not love to drink, yet when he was
forced to it, no one could come up to him; and that he had this
wonderful happiness, as not afterwards to find himself incommoded
by&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Cato, that hero of stoicism, got drunk sometimes, in order to relax
his mind, fatigued with the cares of public employment. These are the
very words of Seneca, Cato <i>vino laxabat animum curis publicis
fatigatum</i>. And the same author says elsewhere, that “People
reproached Cato with drunkenness, but that reproach was rather an honour
to him than otherwise.” <i>Catoni
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
ebrietas objecta est, et facilius efficiet quisquis objecerit honestum
quam turpem Catonem.</i> Horace gives us the same idea of the great
Cato, in these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">

</div>

<div class = "verse trans">
<p>Tradition tells, that oftentimes with wine,</p>
<p>Ev’n Cato’s virtue moisten’d, shone divine.</p>
</div>

<p>If one knew the Scythian philosopher Anacharsis no otherwise than by
his apophthegms against wine and drunkenness, one would take him for the
soberest man in the world, but we know very well that his theory varied
very much upon this point, and no way agreed with his practice. One day
above the rest, having got drunk at an entertainment given by Lybis,
brother to Pittacus, he demanded the prize that was to be given to the
greatest drinker. With which action, when he was afterwards reproached,
he replied, “Can a man better signalize himself in battle than by
glorious wounds? and at table, than with that gaiety you call
drunkenness? Did not Homer, the
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
wisest of your poets, make not only Agamemnon drunk, but Jupiter too,
and made nectar flow in full goblets at the table of the Gods<a class =
"tag" name = "tag13_2" id = "tag13_2" href = "#note13_2">2</a>?” Ælian<a
class = "tag" name = "tag13_3" id = "tag13_3" href = "#note13_3">3</a>
also tells us, that this philosopher drank largely at Periander’s
feasts, and alleged for an excuse, That to drink a great deal was
essential to the Scythians.</p>

<p>Plato, another hero of antiquity, not only permitted, but commanded,
that people should get drunk at some certain times. To prove what I say,
one has no more to do than to read his laws.</p>

<p>Seneca, who was so severe a philosopher, at least his rigid precepts
would make one think him so, thought it no harm now and then to get
drunk, and ranges drunkenness amongst the means he prescribes to
maintain the strength and vigour of the mind. I&nbsp;have quoted what he
says in this respect in the first and second chapter of this work.</p>

<p>The philosopher Arcesilaus, who lived about the 120th Olympiad, might
be reckoned amongst
<span class = "pagenum">83</span>
those who loved wine, since he died by drinking too much of it unmixed.
A&nbsp;greater, and more convincing proof of his sincere love to the
creature could not be given.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>For he that hangs, or beats out’s brains,</p>
<p>The devil’s in him if he feigns<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_4" id =

</div>

<p>Xenocrates<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_5" id = "tag13_5" href =
"#note13_5">5</a>, one of the most illustrious philosophers of ancient
Greece, and of a virtue very rigid and severe, got drunk sometimes.
Ælian has put his name into the catalogue of those who loved drinking,
and could bear a good deal of liquor. Athenæus, says this philosopher,
gained the crown of gold which the tyrant of Syracuse had promised him
that should empty a certain measure of wine. Diogenes Laertius confirms
this last particular. “He had moreover acquired such an empire over his
passions, that a very beautiful courtesan (Phryne) who had laid a wager
she could subdue his virtue, lost it, though she had the liberty to lie
with him, and use all
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
her little toyings to incite him to enjoy her.” You see here (adds Mr.
Bayle) a&nbsp;triumph as remarkable as that of S.&nbsp;Aldhelme, and
some other canonized saints, who came off victorious on such
attacks.</p>

<p>Cicero<a class = "tag" name = "tag13_6" id = "tag13_6" href =
"#note13_6">6</a> assures us, That Stilpo of Megera, the philosopher,
a&nbsp;man of much wit and ability for the times he lived in, loved wine
as well as women; and, that his friends wrote this of him in his praise,
and not dishonour.</p>

<p>Athenæus says, That the philosophers Lacides and Timon, once upon a
time, past two whole days successively in drinking. Ælian puts their
names into his catalogue of hard drinkers; to which he adds Amasis, the
lawgiver of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>Chrysippus the philosopher, native of Solos, a&nbsp;town of Cilicia,
or of Tharsus, according to others, got drunk pretty often. It is said,
That some of his disciples having prevailed upon him to come to a
sacrifice, he drank so much pure wine, that he died five days
afterwards. There are other authors, however, will have it, that he
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
died of immoderate laughter, seeing an ass eat figs out of a dish, and
upon which he commanded they should give him drink.</p>

<span class = "subhead">
OF POETS THAT USED TO GET DRUNK.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">A</span>s</span> wine is the poet’s great horse, so it
must not be wondered at, that the major part of them fuddle their noses;
for, in reality, they cannot properly be said to be mounted on their
great horses, till they have drunk pretty heartily. These gentlemen
speak then on horseback, for the discourse of poets is quite opposite to
that of orators, which Horace says, is a discourse on foot<a class =
"tag" name = "tag14_1" id = "tag14_1" href = "#note14_1">1</a>, but when
they drink nothing we can only say, that they are mounted upon.</p>

<p>The attachment that Homer had to wine, appears
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
in the frequent eulogiums he gives that liquor. And if we examine
Anacreon never so little, we shall find his inclinations, as well as his
verses, were divided between wine and love. As much delicacy and fine
turns as one finds in his works, an honest man cannot see without
indignation, but that they tend absolutely to debauch. One must drink,
one must love. The moments that are not employed in the pleasures of the
senses are lost. Pausanius tells us, that he saw at Athens the statue of
Anacreon, which represented him drunk and singing.</p>

<p>The poet Philoxenus wished he had a neck as long as a crane, that he
might the longer have the pleasure of swallowing wine, and enjoy its
delicious taste.</p>

<p>Ion, the poet of Chios, was not much more sober in respect of wine,
according to Ælian and Euripides.</p>

<p>Horace must by no means be forgotten, whose satires derive from the
grape their sprightfulness and gaiety.</p>

<p>Timocreon of Rhodes, a comic poet in the 75th Olympiad, was a great
drinker. Athenæus has given of him this epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<div class = "verse">
<p>Multa bibens et multa vorans, mala plurima dicens</p>
<p>Multis hic jaceo Timocreon Rhodius.</p>
</div>

<p>To these we may add Alceus and Eunius, of whom we have already made
mention; but what signifies this enumeration, since it is most certain,
that almost all the poets in the world, of all ages, got drunk, which
puts them under the protection of Bacchus. This made them heretofore in
Rome celebrate once a year, in the month of March, a&nbsp;festival in
honour to this God with solemn sacrifices. What Ovid<a class = "tag"
name = "tag14_2" id = "tag14_2" href = "#note14_2">2</a> has said on
this point puts the matter out of all doubt:&mdash;</p>

OF FREE MASONS, AND OTHER LEARNED MEN, THAT USED TO GET
DRUNK.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =

of Long Livers, a&nbsp;book dedicated to the Free Masons, says in his
Preface<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_1" id = "tag15_1" href =
"#note15_1">1</a> to that treatise,
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
be true, those mystical gentlemen very well deserve a place amongst the
learned. But, without entering into their peculiar jargon, or whether a
man can be sacrilegiously perjured for revealing secrets when he has
none, I&nbsp;do assure my readers, they are very great friends to the
vintners. An eye-witness of this was I myself, at their late general
meeting at Stationers’ Hall, who having learned some of their catechism,
passed my examination, paid my five shillings, and took my place
accordingly.</p>

<p>We had a good dinner, and, to their eternal honour, the brotherhood
laid about them very valiantly. They saw then their high dignity; they
saw what they were, acted accordingly, and shewed themselves (what they
were) men<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_2" id = "tag15_2" href =
"#note15_2">2</a>. The Westphalia hams and chickens, with good plum
pudding, not forgetting the delicious salmon, were plentifully
sacrificed, with copious libations
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
of wine for the consolation of the brotherhood. But whether, after a
very disedifying manner their demolishing huge walls of venison pasty,
be building up a spiritual house, I&nbsp;leave to brother Eugenius
Philalethes to determine. However, to do them justice, I&nbsp;must own,
there was no mention made of politics or religion, so well do they seem
to follow the advice of that author<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_3" id
= "tag15_3" href = "#note15_3">3</a>. And when the music began to play,
“Let the king enjoy his own again,” they were immediately reprimanded by
a person of great gravity and science.</p>

<p>The bottle, in the mean while, went merrily about, and the following
healths were begun by a great man, The King, Prince and Princess, and
the Royal Family; the Church as by Law established; Prosperity to Old
England under the present Administration; and Love, Liberty, and
Science; which were unanimously pledged in full bumpers, attended with
loud huzzas.</p>

<p>The faces then of the most ancient and most honourable fraternity of
the Free Masons, brightened with ruddy fires; their eyes illuminated,
resplendent blazed.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<p>Well fare ye, merry hearts, thought I, hail ye illustrious topers, if
liberty and freedom, ye free mortals, is your essential difference,
richly distinguishes you from all others, and is, indeed, the very soul
and spirit of the brotherhood, according to brother Eugenius
Philalethes<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_4" id = "tag15_4" href =

<p>But leaving the Free Masons, and their invaluable secrets, for I know
not what they are worth, come we now to speak of other men of learning,
who loved to indulge their genius with the delicious juice of the grape.
And here we need not fly to antiquity, which would swell this work into
a large volume, later times will furnish us with many a bright example.

<div class = "verse">

<p>So much for poetry, let us come to the point, and instance some
learned men, that have loved this diversion. And first, enter Erasmus,
who certainly was no enemy to wine, since he chose rather to continue
where the plague was than drink water. To prove this, I&nbsp;shall
instance part of a letter written to this great man by Armonius, an
Italian, and a very learned person:&mdash; “Immediately after my arrival
in England, I&nbsp;endeavoured to inform myself where you were, because
in your last you told me, the plague had forced you to quit Cambridge.
At length I was told for certain, that you had indeed left the town, but
retiring into a place where there was no wine, which to you being worse
than the plague, you returned thither, and where you now are.
O&nbsp;intrepid soldier of Bacchus, whom
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
so eminent a danger could not compel to desert his general!” The Latin
having much more force, for the sake of those who understand that
language, I&nbsp;shall take the liberty to insert it, as follows:&mdash;
<i>Simul atque Anglicum solum tetigi, ubi locorum esses rogare cepi,
siquidem Cantabrigiensem pestem fugere te scripsisti. Unus tandem
sixtinus mihi dixit te quidem Cantabrigiam. Ob pestem reliquisse et
concessisse nescio quo, ubi cum vini penuria laborares, et eo carere
gravius peste duceres, Cantabrigiam repetiisse atque ibi nunc esse.

<p>Barthius may also be reckoned amongst those learned topers, if what
Coloniez says be true. “I&nbsp;knew,” says he, “some learned men in

but he found means to make Barthius drunk, that he might entertain the
lady with greater liberty, which he accomplished. It was not, however,
so well managed, but Barthius coming to himself had some reason to
suspect what had past, which grew so much upon him, that he took the
lady along with him in a rage, and drowned her in the Rhine<a class =

<p>“Nicolas de Bourbon, of Bar sur l’Aube, was nephew’s son to the poet
Nicolas Bourbon, who lived in the time of Francis the First; after
having been king’s professor, then canon of Langres, made himself father
of the oratory.<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>He was a
prodigious dry soul, and loved good wine, which made him often say, That
though he was of the French academy, yet that when he read French verses
he fancied he was drinking water.”</p>

<p>The great Buchanan, so famous for his fine writings, was a terrible
drinker, if we may give any credit to Father Garasse. What follows is
taken out of his Doctrine Curieuse, p.&nbsp;748. “I&nbsp;shall,” says
he, “recount to our new atheists, the miserable end of a man of their
belief and humour, as to eating and drinking. The libertine having
passed his debauched youth in Paris and Bourdeaux, more diligent in
finding out tavern bushes than the laurel of Parnassus; and being
towards the latter end of his life, recalled into Scotland, to instruct
the young prince, James VI. continuing his intemperance, he grew at last
so dropsical by drinking, that by way of jeer he said he was in labour.
<i>Vino intercute</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
not <i>aquâ intercute</i>. As ill as he was, he would, however, not
abstain from drinking bumpers, and them too all of pure wine, as he used
to do at Bourdeaux. The physicians who had care of his health, by order
of the king, seeing the extravagant excesses of their patient, told him
roundly, and in a kind of heat, that he did all he could to kill
himself, and that, if he continued this course of life, he could not
live above a fortnight, or three weeks, longer. He desired them then to
hold a consultation amongst themselves, and let him know how long he
might live if he abstained from wine. They did so, and told him, he
might on that condition live five or six years longer. Upon which he
gave them an answer worthy his humour. Go, says he, with your regimens
and prescriptions, and know, that I had rather live three weeks, and get
drunk every day, than six years without drinking wine. And as soon as he
had thus dismissed the physicians, he caused a barrel of wine of Grave
to be placed at his bed’s head, resolving to see the bottom of it before
he died; and carried himself so valiantly in this encounter, that he
drank it up to the lees, fulfilling literally the contents of this

ghastly upon the minister, And what is that, says he, that you call the

<p>I shall not vouch for the truth of this story, but you have it as I
find it; nor must it be expected that Buchanan, who was their mortal

Rome.</p>

<p>Justus Lipsius got sometimes drunk; he tells us so himself, in his
Commentary on Seneca, for in that passage where the philosopher says,
that drunkenness cures some certain distempers, he makes on the word
distempers this remark following&mdash;Melancholy (we&nbsp;know it by
experience) or cold. And in the discourses which he says were carried on
between Carrio Demius and Dusa, upon subjects of literature, and which
he inserts in his Ancient Lessons, they had always a glass in their
hand.</p>

<p>Every one knows that Baudius, professor in the university of Leyden,
was a great drinker,
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
and Culprit himself pleads guilty to the indictment. <i>Habemus rerum
confitentem.</i> Here follow his own words, which I own I cannot
translate without losing their beauty in the Latin, but the substance
is, that he defies envy itself to say any thing against him, but that
like the ancient Cato, he drank pretty liberally of the juice of the
grape. <i>Concurrant omnes</i>, says he, <i>non dicam ut ille satiricus,
Augures, Haruspices, sed quicquid est ubique hominum curiosorum, qui in
aliena acta tam sedulo iniquirunt ut ea fingant quæ nunquam fuerunt,

<p>Balzac made also some little debauches with some of his friends at
his country-house; and what he wrote to an officer who was then prisoner
in Germany, makes it evidently appear that he thought it lawful so to
do. “In relation,” says he, “to the German manner of drinking healths,
which you speak of with such trouble, as if they were so many Turkish
bastinadoes, I&nbsp;think your sobriety in that respect to be a little
too delicate, you must learn to howl when you are in company of wolves,
as the proverb has it, and not to instance great generals. Don’t you
know, that wise ambassadors of kings have heretofore got drunk for the
good of their master’s affairs, and sacrificed all their prudence and
gravity to the necessity of great men, and the custom of the country
where they were. I&nbsp;do not advise you here to any forbidden acts of
intemperance, but I think it no manner of harm now and then to drown
your chagrin in Rhenish wine, and to make use of that agreeable means to
shorten the time, the long continuance of which is ever extremely
tedious to prisoners<a class = "tag" name = "tag15_16" id = "tag15_16"

<p>The illustrious professor of Utrecht, whose name shall live as long
as the republic of letters shall subsist, was a great drinker, and
valued himself for drinking a great deal. It is reported of this learned
man, that at the congress of the last peace, a&nbsp;certain German
prince, of a sovereign house, came on purpose to have a brush with our
professor, who accepted the challenge, and came off victorious, having
fairly laid his enemy speechless on the floor.</p>

<span class = "subhead">
OF NATIONS THAT USED TO GET DRUNK.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">T</span>he</span> plot now begins to thicken upon us, and
we are come to give an account of such nations with whom the custom of
getting drunk was heretofore very much in vogue; and of those
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
with whom this same custom reigns at this very day.</p>

<p>When we consult ancient histories upon this point, we learn from
Plato<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_1" id = "tag16_1" href =
"#note16_1">1</a>, that the Scythians, Thracians, Celtæ and Iberians,
were the greatest drinkers that ever were. Ælian<a class = "tag" name =
"tag16_2" id = "tag16_2" href = "#note16_2">2</a> says the same in
relation to the Thracians and Illyrians. It is also reported of the
Parthians<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_3" id = "tag16_3" href =
"#note16_3">3</a>, that the more they drink the more thirsty they
grow.</p>

<p>Athenæus<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_4" id = "tag16_4" href =
"#note16_4">4</a> also assures us, that the Thracians were great
drinkers; and he says the same thing of the Milesians, Illyrians,
Lydians, Persians, Carthaginians, Gauls, and Spaniards.</p>

<p>The Tapyrians were so much given to wine, that they past their whole
lives in drinking, and even bathed their bodies in wine<a class = "tag"
name = "tag16_5" id = "tag16_5" href = "#note16_5">5</a>.</p>

<p>The Tarentins used to drink from morning till night, and got quite
drunk in public<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_6" id = "tag16_6" href =
"#note16_6">6</a>.</p>

<p>The Leontins, a people in Sicily, were such
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
great drunkards, that they occasioned this proverb, viz. the Leontins
are always near a cup of wine<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_7" id =
"tag16_7" href = "#note16_7">7</a>.</p>

<p>The Byzantins must not be refused a place in this chapter. Ælian
reports<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_8" id = "tag16_8" href =
"#note16_8">8</a>, that Leonides, their general, being besieged, and
unable to make his men keep their posts, which they quitted every moment
to go and get drunk at the taverns, he immediately gave orders that the
vintners should repair with all their liquors to the ramparts, by which
stratagem he kept them to their duty.</p>

<p>But as it may be said that the nations we have already mentioned were
all barbarous, we shall, for that reason, verify what Montaigne says,
that amongst nations the best regulated, and most polite, this essay of
drinking deep was very much in use<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_9" id =
"tag16_9" href = "#note16_9">9</a>.</p>

<p>The Greeks, whom one may look upon as the only nation of the world
for politeness and good sense, are a proof of what I advance. They
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
celebrated the feasts of Bacchus with a great deal of solemnity; it is
from them that Pergræcari, of which every one knows the signification,
is derived. Ælian assures us, that they were so very luxurious, that
they put perfumed oils into their wine, which they called wine of
myrrh.</p>

<p>The Romans had also a very strong passion for wine, so that at Rome
there were frequently very great seditions for want of it. <i>Seditiones
sunt concitatæ graves ob inopiam vini</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tag16_10" id = "tag16_10" href = "#note16_10">10</a>, says Ammianus
Marcellinus, in the Life of Constantius and Gallus; and in the reign of
Constantius only, the same historian says, there was a sedition also
upon that very account.</p>

<p>Titus Livius tells us, that the Clusians passed the Alps, and came to
inhabit the country that the Etrurians possessed before, to have the
pleasure of drinking wine<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_11" id =
"tag16_11" href = "#note16_11">11</a>.</p>

<p>Let us now descend to some nations, with whom, at present, this
custom of getting drunk is received.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<p>Sir Paul Ricaut<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_12" id = "tag16_12"
href = "#note16_12">12</a> assures us, that the Turks considering that
wine rejoices the heart, and comforts the stomach, have begun to drink
it; adding, that at present there are only a few (ulamah) ecclesiastical
hypocrites or some ignorant bigots, or superannuated people, that
abstain from that liquor; but at the same time drunkenness is grown very
common amongst them.</p>

<p>M. Du Mont confirms this truth, “As to wine,” says he, “though it be
as expressly forbidden as swine’s flesh, it is nevertheless very certain
that a great many Mahometans transgress that precept; and the justest
thing that I can say in that respect is, that abstinence from wine is
observed there almost after the same manner as Lent in France<a class =
"tag" name = "tag16_13" id = "tag16_13" href = "#note16_13">13</a>.”</p>

<p>The Persians too drink wine to excess, though their law forbids the
use of it; and they say for an excuse, “That it is to pass away the
time, and sweeten the cares that surprise them<a class = "tag" name =
"tag16_14" id = "tag16_14" href = "#note16_14">14</a>.”</p>

<p>The Armenians are no way behind the Persians,
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
if we may believe Tavernier, who says, that with them, “He that treats
thinks he has handsomely acquitted himself of his entertainment, if his
guests cannot find the door when they have a mind to go home, which
would very often happen, without the assistance of their servants, who
lead them, and yet have not power enough sometimes to keep them from
falling down in the room, or in the street, which is a great
satisfaction to the host; for if he finds any of them master of so much
judgment as to guide himself, though he reels never so much, he laments
very much, as having the misfortune of spending his money to no
purpose<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_15" id = "tag16_15" href =
"#note16_15">15</a><ins class = "notation" title = "close quote missing">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>The Siameze drink wine very heartily when they can get it, though
every thing that may intoxicate them is forbidden by their law<a class =
"tag" name = "tag16_16" id = "tag16_16" href = "#note16_16">16</a>.</p>

<p>Father le Clerc, author of a Relation of Gaspesia, assures us, that
drunkenness is the favourite vice of the inhabitants of that country<a
class = "tag" name = "tag16_17" id = "tag16_17" href =
"#note16_17">17</a>.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the coast of Africa are great
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
drunkards; they would give all they had in the world for a glass of
brandy. At Loanda, capital of the kingdom of Angola, a&nbsp;firkin of
wine sells for above thirty pounds sterling. They love it extremely, and
they tell you a pleasant story hereupon of the great duke of Bamba,
which is a province of the king of Congo, viz. that he once refused the
crown, as he himself owned to the fathers missioners, that he might be
always near the Portuguese, and drink, by their means, sometimes a
little wine or brandy<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_18" id = "tag16_18"
href = "#note16_18">18</a>.</p>

<p>The Muscovites love wine with a kind of fury, and it has been known,
that when a man who has drunk to excess, and can swallow no more, they
wash him soundly with it. And in Germany you are not looked upon to have
treated your guest like a friend, if you do not reduce him to that
condition, as quite to forget himself, and know not what he does<a class
= "tag" name = "tag16_19" id = "tag16_19" href =
"#note16_19">19</a>.</p>

<p>“As Georgia produces strong wines, so its inhabitants are great
drunkards, the strongest liquors is what they love most; and at their
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
entertainments they drink more brandy than wine, women as well as men.<a
class = "tag" name = "tag16_20" id = "tag16_20" href =

<p>Sir John Chardin<a class = "tag" name = "tag16_21" id = "tag16_21"
href = "#note16_21">21</a> assures us, That there is no country in the
world where they drink so much wine, and more excellent, than they do at
Georgia; adding, that the Georgians are great drunkards, and that the
clergy get drunk as well as the laity.</p>

drawing than in Billingsgate. It is, however, in such meetings, that
alliances and reconciliations are formed. Here they treat of the
election of princes. In short, of all affairs, of peace and war. Those
opportunities they think most proper, inasmuch as then people shake off

<p>Owen, our countryman, has made an epitaph in honour of these our
substantial topers, the Germans; the sense of which is, that if truth
lies hidden in wine, they are the first people
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
in the world that will find it out. His words are,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Si latet in vino verum, ut proverbia dicunt,</p>
<p>Invenit verum Teuto vel inveniet.</p>
</div>

<p>Let us see now what travellers have said on this subject of the
Germans: and we will begin with M.&nbsp;Aug. de Thou<a class = "tag"
name = "tag17_3" id = "tag17_3" href = "#note17_3">3</a>, an eye-witness
thereof. “There is,” says he, “before Mulhausen, a&nbsp;large place, or
square, where, during the fair, assemble a prodigious number of people,
of both sexes, and of all ages; there one may see wives supporting their
husbands, daughters their fathers, tottering upon their horses or asses,
a&nbsp;true image of a Bacchanal. The public-houses are full of
drinkers, where the young women who wait, pour wine into goblets out of
a large bottle with a long neck, without spilling one drop. They press
you to drink with pleasantries the most agreeable in the world. People
drink here continually, and return at all hours to do the same thing
over again.”</p>

<p>This pleasant sight, so new to M. de Thou,
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
continues almost all night. And what is very particular amongst such a
great concourse of people, and such a number of drunkards, every thing
passes without dispute and quarrelling.</p>

<p>Let us now see what the duke de Rohan says on this head, whose words
are these<a class = "tag" name = "tag17_4" id = "tag17_4" href =
"#note17_4">4</a>:&mdash; “From thence I came to Trent, a&nbsp;place
noways agreeable, and famous for nothing but the last council which was
held there; and if it was not that it was half Italian, (being glad of
coming out of little Barbary, and a universal tippling-house,)
I&nbsp;would take no notice of it; being well satisfied, that the
mathematicians of our times can no where find out the perpetual motion
so well as here, where the goblets of Germans are an evident
demonstration of its possibility&mdash;they think they cannot make good
cheer, nor permit friendship or fraternity, as they call it, with any,
without giving the seal brimful of wine, to seal it for perpetuity.”</p>

<p>M. Misson, who was also some time in Germany, gives us yet a larger
description. “The Germans,” says he<a class = "tag" name = "tag17_5" id
= "tag17_5" href = "#note17_5">5</a>, “are, as you know,
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
strange drinkers. There are no people in the world more caressing, more
civil, more officious, but still another cup. They have terrible customs
on that article of drinking. Every thing is transacted over the bottle;
you can do nothing without drinking. One can scarce speak three words at
a visit, but you are astonished to see the collation come in, or at
least a good quantity of wine, attended with crusts of bread cut into
little pieces, upon a plate with salt and pepper, a&nbsp;fatal
preparative for bad drinkers. I&nbsp;must instruct you in the laws they
observe in their cups; laws sacred and inviolable. You must never drink
without drinking some one’s health, which having done, you must
immediately present the glass to the party you drank to, who must never
refuse it, but drink it to the last drop. Reflect a little,
I&nbsp;beseech you, on these customs, and you will see how, and by what
means, it is impossible to cease from drinking. After this manner one
shall never have done. It is a perpetual circle to drink after the
German fashion; it is to drink for ever. You must likewise know, that
the glasses too are respected in those countries as much as the wine is
loved; they range
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
them all about in ranks and files; most of their rooms are wainscotted
up two thirds of the wall, and the glasses are ranged all about, like
organ pipes, upon the cornish. They begin with the small, and end with
the large ones, which are like melon glasses, and must be taken off at
one draught, when they drink any health of importance.”</p>

<p>Let us observe here<a class = "tag" name = "tag17_6" id = "tag17_6"
href = "#note17_6">6</a>, “That it was the custom of the ancient Greeks
to drink largely after meals, and that this custom is now practised in
Germany.” This was what Æneas, and the people of his train, used to do,
as we learn from these verses of Virgil<a class = "tag" name = "tag17_7"
id = "tag17_7" href = "#note17_7">7</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">

<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<p>It is the same thing with the Armenians, they never drink till at the
end of their meals. “After they have said grace, the dishes are removed,
in order to bring in the <ins class = "notation" title = "spelling unchanged">desert</ins>,
and then they prepare themselves to drink to excess.”</p>

<p>We come now to the Swiss. Here follows what Daniel Eremita,
a&nbsp;very learned man, who published a description of their country,
has said of them. “<a class = "tag" name = "tag17_8" id = "tag17_8" href
= "#note17_8">8</a>They have the same simplicity in drinking, but they
do not keep the same moderation. Wine is what they place their delight
in, and they prefer it to all things in the world. At their assemblies,
both for pleasure and business, or any other affairs, wine always makes
a party; with which, when they have overloaded their stomach, they
discharge it, and sit down to it again, and drink as they did at first.
They leave the care of their family to their wives and children, who
live with the utmost economy, in favour of their husbands, who are
continually at the tavern. They talk with glass in hand, and please
themselves in that posture to recount their acts and jests, and those of
their ancestors, as examples to posterity.
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
They speak freely all they know, and know not what a secret is. In
short, this way of life does not only continue whole days successively,
but all the time they live.”</p>

<p>Nor have things now taken another aspect in Switzerland. The author
of a travel lately into that country, tells us for certain, that “wine
is a singular attractive, a&nbsp;powerful charm, against which the Swiss
can make no manner of resistance<a class = "tag" name = "tag17_9" id =
"tag17_9" href = "#note17_9">9</a>.”</p>

<p>Before I close this chapter I shall take notice of the Flemings, whom
we ought to look upon as making part of Germany, who, though they are
surrounded by water, take care never to drink any, which made Scaliger,
when in Holland, say to Douza,</p>

<div class = "verse">

<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<p>Guicciardin, in his description of the low countries, accuses the
people of drinking too much. <i><ins class = "correction" title =
"printed in roman (non-italic)">Hanno</ins></i><a class = "tag" name =
"tag17_11" id = "tag17_11" href = "#note17_11">11</a>, says he, <i>poi
per la maggior parte quel vitio del bere troppo</i>. He adds, however,
“That they are in some sort excusable, because the air of the country
being for the most part of the year humid, and apt to inspire
melancholy, they could not, perhaps, make use of a more efficacious
remedy to expel this irksome, unwholesome melancholy, than wine, which,
I&nbsp;suppose, was Horace’s sentiment, when he said, With wine drive
away <ins class = "notation" title = "close quote missing">care.</ins>
The words in the original are, <i>Ma sono in qualche parte scusabili,
per che essendo l’aria del paese il pui del tempo humida et malinconica,

<p>But without any farther talking of the Germans, I&nbsp;shall end this

<p>Those nations, with whom there are no vines, have invented other
drinks to make themselves merry. Pliny<a class = "tag" name = "tag18_2"
id = "tag18_2" href = "#note18_2">2</a> tells us, That the western
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
people got drunk with certain liquors made with fruits; and that these
liquors have different names in Gaul and Spain, though they produce the
same effect.</p>

<p>Ammianus Marcellinus reports, That the Gauls having no wine in their
country, though they are very fond of it, contrive a great many sorts of
liquors, which produce the same effect as wine. <i>Vini avidum genus
adfectans ad vini similitum dinem multiplices potus.</i></p>

<p>The Scythians had no wine, as appears by the answer of Anacharsis,
the philosopher, who being asked, If they had none that played on the
flute in Scythia, replied, That they had not so much as any wine there.
However, for all that, they got drunk with certain liquors which had the
force and strength of wine. This also we learn from these words of
Virgil:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Ipsi in defossis specubus, secura subaltâ</p>

<p>The Thracians intoxicate themselves by swallowing the fumes of
certain herbs, which they cast into the fire.</p>

<p>The Babylonians, according to Herodotus, used likewise to get drunk,
by swallowing the fumes of certain herbs that they burned.</p>

<p>Strabo reports, That the Indians made a certain drink with sugar
canes, which made them merry; very probably not unlike what we now call
rum.</p>

<p>Benso, in his History of America, says the same of the inhabitants of
the island of Hispaniola, and several other provinces of America.</p>

<p>Pliny and Athenæus tell us, that the Egyptians fuddled themselves
with a drink made of barley; by this it seems the liquor of Sir John
Barley-Corn is very ancient.</p>

<p>Leri<a class = "tag" name = "tag18_3" id = "tag18_3" href =
"#note18_3">3</a>, in his Voyage to Brazil, tells us, That the
inhabitants of that country are as great drinkers as the Germans,
Flemings, Lansquenets,
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
Swiss: and all those merry gentleman who love carousing, and drink
supernaculum, ought to agree, that they are even with them. Their drink
is made of certain roots, which they boil and ferment, and is then
called by them in their language, <i>cahou-in</i>. The author adds,
“That he has seen them not only drink three days and nights successively
without ceasing, but that they were so very drunk, that they could
swallow no more till they had disgorged, which was in order to begin
again.</p>

<p>“There <a class = "tag" name = "tag18_4" id = "tag18_4" href =
"#note18_4">4</a>grows in the Eastern countries certain particular
drugs, with which the inhabitants are wonderfully delighted, and which
produce a kind of drunkenness, or agreeable folly, which continues some
time. They are so much accustomed to the use of these drugs, by a long
habit, that they imagine that life must be very sad and unhappy without
them. The Indians and Persians have their bangué, the Egyptians their
bola, and the Turks their opium.”</p>

<p>In relation to the Persians, Tavernier<a class = "tag" name =
"tag18_5" id = "tag18_5" href = "#note18_5">5</a> has these words, viz.
“They have a sort of drink to divert and make themselves merry, which
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
they call kokemaar, made of poppy-seeds boiled. They drink it scalding
hot; and there are particular houses, called kokemaar kronè, where
people meet, and give a great deal of pleasure and delight to those who
see the ridiculous postures which this kind of liquor makes them
perform. Before it operates they quarrel with one another, and give
abusive language, without coming to blows; afterwards when the drug
begins to have its effect, then they also begin to make peace. One
compliments in a very high degree, another tells stories, but all are
extremely ridiculous both in their words and actions.” And after having
spoken of other liquors that they make use of, he adds, “It is difficult
to find in Persia a man that is not addicted to some one of these
liquors, without which they think they cannot live but very
unpleasantly.”</p>

<p>I take no notice here of that admirable drink called Punch with us;
nor Juniper-water, (vulgarly called Geneva, a&nbsp;corruption from the
French word Genevre, which signifies the same thing,) nor that dram
called All-fours, which have such wonderful effects on the wretched
commonalty.</p>

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IN FAVOUR OF DRUNKENNESS.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">D</span>runkenness</span> will (and ought to do so) appear
excusable to people the most sober, if they would but make these two
reflections following, viz.</p>


<h4>I. <i>That drunkards are not generally given to lewdness.</i></h4>

<p>Aristotle says, “That too much drinking makes one very improper for
the acts of Venus, and gives his reasons. Athenæus reports the same
thing in that passage, where he makes mention of the drunkenness of
Alexander the Great, a&nbsp;vice,” says he, “which, perhaps, was the
cause of his little inclination for the ladies.”</p>

<p>Montaigne<a class = "tag" name = "tag19_1" id = "tag19_1" href =
"#note19_1">1</a> speaks very well on this article,
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
“These,” says he, “are two things which vigorously oppose each other;
this weakens our stomach on one hand; whereas, on the other, sobriety
serves to make us more quaint and delicate in the exercise of love.”</p>

<p>Ovid<a class = "tag" name = "tag19_2" id = "tag19_2" href =
"#note19_2">2</a> says much the same thing.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Vina parant animum veneri, nisi plurima sumas,</p>
<p>Ut stupeant multo corda sepulta mero.”</p>
</div>

<div class = "verse trans">
<p>Wine, not too much, inspires, and makes the mind</p>
<p>To the soft joys of Venus strong inclin’d,</p>
<p>Which buried in excess, unapt to love,</p>
<p>Stupidly lies, and knows not how to move.</p>
</div>


<h4>II. <i>That in those countries where they do not drink to excess,
they are very much addicted to debauchery.</i></h4>

<p>It is certain, that in hot countries they drink a great deal less
than they do in cold, but in lieu of that, lewdness reigns much more.
Montaigne<a class = "tag" name = "tag19_3" id = "tag19_3" href =
"#note19_3">3</a>, after having observed, that they began to drink less
than they used to do, adds, “Does
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
any one think it tends to amendment? No, indeed; but, perhaps, we are
much more given to whoring than our forefathers.”</p>

<p>This puts me in mind of an Italian, who having reproached a German
with the drunkenness of his country, by these verses, viz.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Germani multos possunt tolerare labores</p>
<p>O utinam possint tam tolerare sitim.”</p>
</div>

<div class = "verse trans">
<p>The Germans (patient) toil, inur’d to pain,</p>
<p>Oh! could they but their thirst so well sustain!</p>
</div>

<p>The German answered him extempore in these other two:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Ut nos vitis amor, sic vos Venus improba vexat</p>
<p>Est data lex veneri Julia, nulla mero.”</p>
</div>

<div class = "verse trans">
<p>As we love wine, so wicked Venus you,</p>
<p>Twas <i>this</i>, not <i>that</i>, the Julian Edict knew.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to draw a consequence from all this, let us speak once more
of Montaigne<a class = "tag" name = "tag19_4" id = "tag19_4" href =
"#note19_4">4</a>, whose words are, “And if we cannot give any pleasure
but what costs us something, as the ancients
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
maintain, I&nbsp;find this vice costs the conscience less than all the
rest, besides, it is in this respect no despicable consideration, that a
man advanced in honours, amongst three principal conveniencies of life,
that he told me he yet enjoyed, he reckoned this for one.”</p>

<p>After having shewn, in the foregoing chapters, That drunkenness
reigns all the world over, <i>Nulla in parte mundi cessat ebrietas</i>.
Let us see what we may hence infer in its favour: and I ask, if the
agreement of so many different nations, to do one and the same thing,
proves nothing, and may not, in some measure, serve as an apology for
drunkenness? For if one considers, that the surprising variety of the
humour and temperament of men, do, notwithstanding, in nowise hinder
them from agreeing unanimously in this point, one shall have a very
strong temptation to believe, that the desire of getting drunk is an
innate quality, and we shall be confirmed in this sentiment, after
tasting experimentally the exquisite sweetness caused by
drunkenness.</p>

<span class = "subhead">
AN ANSWER TO THE OBJECTION, THAT DRUNKENNESS CAUSES
INFINITE&nbsp;EVILS.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">A</span>fter</span> having specified the good qualities of
drunkenness, let us now answer some frivolous objections that may be
made against what we have here advanced. For example, people will
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
not be wanting immediately to object, that drunkenness has been the
cause of infinite evils.</p>

<p>To this I answer, that it has been only the cause of these evils when
people have pushed it too far, and not observed the rules they ought to
keep in drinking, and which we shall see here prescribed by and by. For
where do we find that any one, of so many grave philosophers that used
to get drunk, made any disorders? It was for this reason that
Chrisippus’s maid said, That her master was drunk in the hams. And it
was on this very account, perhaps, that the Stoics said of their sage,
“That he was, indeed, to be overcome with wine, but would not, however,
be drunk, <i>Vino obrutum iri non ebrium tamen futurum</i>.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, without being willing to excuse those disorders
which drunkenness has been the cause of, one may say, nevertheless, that
some of these disorders have produced effects highly advantageous.
“Suppose, for example, that Lot had not got drunk, and his two daughters
had not been possessed with the furious desire of having children, and
the fear of dying maids, you ruin, by this means, whole families, who
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
bore a great part in the wonderful events of the children of Israel<a
class = "tag" name = "tag20_1" id = "tag20_1" href =
"#note20_1">1</a>.”</p>

<p>Their high mightinesses the States of Holland, have eternal
obligations to drunkenness, since to this they owe, in some sort, the
establishment of their republic, which was after this manner, according
to Strada:&mdash; <a class = "tag" name = "tag20_2" id = "tag20_2" href
= "#note20_2">2</a>The same day that Brederode, accompanied by above two
hundred gentlemen, had presented that famous petition to Margaret of
Parma, who then governed the Netherlands, he gave a magnificent
entertainment in the house of the Count of Culenbourg, there was no want
of drinking; and as they saw the Count of Hoocstrate, who by chance
passed that way, they began, with a great deal of joy, to give one
another the name of Gueux<a class = "tag" name = "tag20_3" id =
"tag20_3" href = "#note20_3">3</a>; upon which taking each of them all
together great glasses in their hands, they made vows and oaths to each
other by the name of Gueux, and cried out with one voice and general
applause, Long live the Gueux! After which they promised mutual
fidelity; and
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
the Prince of Orange and the Counts of Egmont and Horn coming to them,
they began to drink again, and with great acclamation renewed vows and
wishes with these new comers, as they had already done, for the Gueux.
At last, in the heat of wine, they took those vigorous resolutions, the
effects of which were afterwards seen, which was the liberty of the
United Provinces.</p>

AN ANSWER TO THE OBJECTION, THAT THE MIRTH WHICH WINE INSPIRES IS
CHIMERICAL.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =

<p>Love, wisdom, knowledge, riches, phantoms all.</p>
</div>

<p>But before we thoroughly refute this objection, I&nbsp;shall observe
by the way, that errors and illusions are necessary to the world. “<a
class = "tag" name = "tag21_1" id = "tag21_1" href = "#note21_1">1</a>In
general, indeed, it is true to say, that the world, as it is now, cannot
keep itself in the same condition,
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
were not men full of a thousand false prejudices and unreasonable
passions; and if philosophy went about to make men act according to the
clear and distinct ideas of reason, we might, perhaps, be satisfied,
that mankind would quickly be at an end. Errors, passions, prejudices,
and a hundred other the like faults, are as a necessary evil to the
world. Men would be worth nothing for this world, were they cured, and
the greatest part of the things which now take up our time, would be
useless, as Quintilian well knew, namely, eloquence<ins class =
"notation" title = "close quote missing">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>Things are in this condition, and will not easily change, and we may
wait long enough for such a happy revolution, before we shall be able to
say, with Virgil,</p>

<p class = "verse">
“Magnus ab integro sæculorum nascitur ordo.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tag21_1a" id = "tag21_1a" href = "#note21_1a">1a</a></p>

<div class = "verse trans">
<p>A series long of ages now appear,</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, “<a class = "tag" name = "tag21_2" id = "tag21_2"
href = "#note21_2">2</a>If you take away from man every thing that is
chimerical, what
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>

permit us to search them to the bottom; one must only just touch them
and away. They resemble boggy and moorish ground, we must run lightly
over them, without ever letting our feet make the least impression.”</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>No, wheresoe’er we turn our wishing eye,</p>
<p>True pleasures never can our souls enjoy.</p>
</div>

<p>Let us add, “<a class = "tag" name = "tag21_3" id = "tag21_3" href =
"#note21_3">3</a>That if we did not help to deceive ourselves, we should
never enjoy any pleasure at all. The most agreeable things in this world
are, in the bottom, so trivial, that they would not much affect us, if
we made but never so little serious reflection upon them. Pleasures are
not made to be strictly examined into, and we are obliged every day to
pass over a great many things in them, about which it would not be
proper to make one-self uneasy.”</p>

<p>Besides, “<a class = "tag" name = "tag21_4" id = "tag21_4" href =
"#note21_4">4</a>Is not the illusion we enjoy as
<span class = "pagenum">137</span>

<p>And this illusion for some time repairs</p>
<p>The want of real joys, which niggard Nature</p>

</div>

<p>“Enjoyment,” says Montaigne<a class = "tag" name = "tag21_6" id =
"tag21_6" href = "#note21_6">6</a>, “and possession, belong principally
to imagination, which embraces more eagerly that which it is in pursuit
of, than that which we have in our power.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
<p>And certainly, one may pronounce them happy, who thus amuse
themselves, and believe themselves to be so. And indeed, when a man is
so far gone in this persuasion, every thing that is alleged to the
contrary is rejected as a fable.</p>

<p>But to shew, at present, the reality, if one may say so, of mere
illusion, we need go no farther than the poets, who are certainly the
happiest mortals living in that respect.</p>

<p>To instance no more, there’s Mr. <span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>, who would fain be a rhimer,
and that is his folly; but though the poor man, for his insipid verses,
and improper epithets, richly deserves our pity, yet is he wonderfully
pleased with his performances, and with a great deal of tranquillity
mounts up Parnassus, in his own conceit, in loftier tracts than Virgil
or Theocritus ever knew. But, alas! what would become of him, if some
audacious person should dare unbind his eyes, and make him see his weak
and graceless lines, which, however smoothly they may run, are, at best,
but exquisitely dull; contain terms that have no meaning in them, and
have no other ornament, but unintelligible jingle, and
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
initial letters? How would he curse the day which deprived his senseless
soul of that happy error that so much charmed his thoughts, and amused
his imagination?</p>

<p>What is here said of the poets is applicable to all mankind; and so a
man, whom any one should undertake to persuade, that the mirth and joy
inspired by wine is chimerical, would do well to answer him, after the
manner as a certain madman did the doctor that cured him. The story is
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>Once upon a time a certain bigot, otherwise a man of sense, had his
brain a little touched with whimsies, and continually fancied he heard
the heavenly music of the blessed spirits. At last a physician, very
expert in his profession, cured him, either by his skill, or by chance,
no matter which; but when he came to demand his fees; for what? says the
other, in a violent passion, by your damned slip-slops and hellish art,
you have robbed me of my Paradise, though you have cured me of my error.
This I borrow from Boileau<a class = "tag" name = "tag21_7" id =
"tag21_7" href = "#note21_7">7</a>, as he did from Horace<a class =
"tag" name = "tag21_8" id = "tag21_8" href = "#note21_8">8</a>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<p>“<a class = "tag" name = "tag21_9" id = "tag21_9" href =
"#note21_9">9</a>There are,” says Pere Bouhours, writing to Bussi
Rabutin, “agreeable errors, which are much more valuable than that which
the Spaniards called desengano, and which might be called in our
language disabusement, if this word, which one of our best writers has
ventured upon, had been received.”</p>

<p>We shall conclude with M. de Sacy<a class = "tag" name = "tag21_10"
id = "tag21_10" href = "#note21_10">10</a>, “That it is not always doing
mankind an agreeable service to dissipate their illusions.” And we say
of those who taste those satisfactions wine inspires, what M.&nbsp;Bayle
says very pleasantly of news-mongers who are still in hopes of what they
wish for. “They are<a class = "tag" name = "tag21_11" id = "tag21_11"
href = "#note21_11">11</a>,” says he, “the least unhappy, whatever
happens. There is a great deal of reality in their agreeable sentiments,
how chimerical soever their foundation may be; so that they do not
willingly suffer themselves to be disabused; and they sometimes say,
when one gives them reasons why they should believe the news, that makes
them so joyful, is doubtful or
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
absolutely false, Why do you envy us the pleasures we enjoy? Do not
disturb our entertainment, or rob us of what we hold most dear.
A&nbsp;friend more opposite to error than charity is a very troublesome
reasoner; and if he meddles with their chimeras they will endeavour to
do him a diskindness.”</p>

<p>We come now to another objection, and that is, that this joy inspired
by wine is but of a very short continuance; and the pleasure one tastes
in so short a space, dearly repaid with a long and tedious uneasiness.
<i>Ebrietas unius horæ hilarem insaniam longo temporis tedio
pensat.</i></p>

<p>I own that it is a very great misery, that our pleasures are so
short: and the shorter too, the more exquisite they are. And, perhaps,
this may be a kindness to us, since some are so superlatively so, that
should they continue a much longer space, mankind could not support
themselves under these ecstacies. But be this as it will, can we make
them otherwise than they are? We must therefore have patience, and take
them as we find them. In short, there is no present happiness in the
world; all we can do, is to
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
be contented with the present, not uneasy at what is to come, but
sweeten with an equality of soul the bitter miseries of human life.</p>

<h3><a name = "chap22" id = "chap22">CHAP. XXII.</a><br>
<span class = "subhead">
AN ANSWER TO THE OBJECTION, THAT ONE LOSES ONE’S REASON IN GETTING
DRUNK.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">I</span>t</span> is objected here, that reason ought to be
the motive of all our actions; and, of consequence, that we ought not
voluntarily to lose&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>To this objection I answer several ways:&mdash; First and foremost
then, I&nbsp;say, people do well to talk to us so much of reason, when
almost all mankind acts without reason, so that it may pass for a thing
that has no manner of existence but in the imagination. We shall prove
this from M.&nbsp;Bayle. “<a class = "tag" name = "tag22_1" id =
"tag22_1" href = "#note22_1">1</a>We are defined,” says he,
“a&nbsp;reasonable
<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
animal. A&nbsp;very fine definition indeed, when none of us do any thing
but without reason. I&nbsp;assure you, sir, that one may say of reason,
what Euripides said in the beginning of one of his tragedies, and which
afterwards was corrected, on account of the murmurings of the people.
O&nbsp;Jupiter, for of thee I know nothing but only the name! In
relation to the faculty I am talking of, we know nothing more of it than
that, so that we may well laugh at the complaints of that heathen
philosopher, who found that reason was a very troublesome present sent
to us by the gods for our ruin; for he supposed, that reason busied
herself in our affairs, whereas the truth of it is she never meddles in
the least with them. We act nothing but with prejudice, by instinct, by
self-love, and the sudden starts of a thousand passions, which drag and
turn our reason as they will, insomuch that one may most justly define
the principle which rules and domineers over us, a&nbsp;mass of
prejudices and passions which knows how to draw consequences.
I&nbsp;remember to have seen a man, who having never heard mention made
of the Cotta of Cicero, said nevertheless as well as he, that it would
have been
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
much better that God had not made us reasonable, since reason poisons
all our affairs, and makes us ingenious to afflict ourselves, upon which
a certain person said to him in raillery, That he had what he desired;
that he had received so small a share of reason that it was not worth
his while to complain. For my part, I&nbsp;turned the thing otherwise,
that people were much in the wrong to murmur against reason, since it is
not that which guides us; and that it is not too possible it should,
without overthrowing the order which has reigned so long in the world.
The learned Erasmus, continued I, deserves the highest praise in this
respect; he has written The Praise of Folly, wherein he shews that she
sheds every where her influence, and without her, the whole world would
in a short time be turned topsy turvy. I&nbsp;make no doubt, sir, but
you know the merit of that work. The author speaks, though in a merry
manner, the greatest truths in the world; and I do not know whether he
believed himself as profound a philosopher, as he really was in that
ingenious satire.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
<p>Secondly, This is not all, “<a class = "tag" name = "tag22_2" id =
"tag22_2" href = "#note22_2">2</a>It is sometimes necessary, for the
general good of the world, to follow prejudices, popular errors, and the
blind instincts of nature, rather than the distinct ideas of reason.”
Mr. Bayle extends himself farther on this idea in another place<a class
= "tag" name = "tag22_3" id = "tag22_3" href = "#note22_3">3</a>, which
I shall here insert. “Errors,” says he, “irregular passions, and
unreasonable prejudices, are so necessary to the world to make it a
theatre of that prodigious diversity of events which make one admire his
providence. So that he who would reduce men to do nothing but according
to the distinct ideas of reason, would ruin civil society. If man was
reduced to this condition, he would have no longer any desire of glory;
and having no longer that desire, is it not true, that then mankind
would be like ice? I&nbsp;say, he would have no desire of glory, for
right reason shews us, that we should not make our happiness depend on
the judgment of other men; and consequently, that we should not toil and
fatigue ourselves, to make other people say this, or that, of
<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
us <span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span><ins class = "correction"
title = ". missing">. </ins>The earnest desire of being praised after
death is an instinct of morality that God has impressed in the mind of
man, to keep up society. And it is certain, that earnest desire has been
the cause of the greatest events; and this ought to instruct us that the
world stands in need of a great many instincts, which, examined
according to the ideas of our reason, are ridiculous and absurd. For
there is nothing so opposite to reason as to torment ourselves in this
life, that we may be praised after we are dead, since neither
philosophy, nor experience, nor faith, nor any thing whatsover, makes it
appear, that the praises given us after death can do us any good. It
would be a thing uneasy to the heart of man, if we did nothing but
according to the light of reason; and how many designs would come to
nothing at the same time?”</p>

<p>Thirdly, Besides, reason very often serves for nothing but to make us
wretched. “The happiness of man is never the work of reason.” Of all our
evils reason is often the worst; it frightens us in the full career of
our pleasures, and with importunate remorses comes to bridle our fleet
desires. The horrid thing reserves for us most
<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
cruel and matchless rigours. It is like a troublesome pedant one is
forced to hear, who always growls, but never touches us, and frequently
like D<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and such like
venerable impertinents, lose the time they employ in predication.</p>

<p>“If there be any happiness<a class = "tag" name = "tag22_4" id =
"tag22_4" href = "#note22_4">4</a>,” says Fontenelle, “that reason
produces, it is like that sort of health which cannot be maintained but
by the force of physic, and which is ever most feeble and uncertain.”
And in another place he cries out, “<a class = "tag" name = "tag22_5" id
= "tag22_5" href = "#note22_5">5</a>Can we not have sound sight without
being at the same time wretched and uneasy? Is there any thing gay but
error? And is reason made for any thing else but to torment and kill
us?” “<a class = "tag" name = "tag22_6" id = "tag22_6" href =
"#note22_6">6</a>What cause have not men to bewail their wretched
condition? Nature furnishes them but with a very few things that are
agreeable, and their reason teaches them how to enjoy them yet less.”
“<a class = "tag" name = "tag22_7" id = "tag22_7" href =
"#note22_7">7</a>And why has Nature, in giving us passions which are
sufficient to make
<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
us happy, given us reason, that will not suffer us to be&nbsp;so?”</p>

<p>It was this same troublesome reason that made Sophocles say, “<a
class = "tag" name = "tag22_8" id = "tag22_8" href = "#note22_8">8</a>It
is very sweet to live, but none of your wisdom, away with her, she
spoils life.”</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Vaunt less thy reason, O unhappy man!</p>
<p>Behold how useless is this gift celestial,</p>
<p>For which, they say, thou should’st the rest disdain.</p>
<p>Feeble as thou wert in thy infant days,</p>
<p>Like thee she mov’d, she totter’d, and was weak.</p>
<p>When age mature arriv’d, and call’d to pleasures,</p>

<p>Pregnant with thousand cares and worlds of woes,</p>
<p>The hateful issue in thy breast she threw,</p>
<p>And now grown old thou loosest her for ever.</p>
</div>

<p>Before I end this chapter, let every body take notice, that if for
having spoken so much against reason, any one should say, that it is a
plain sign the author has none; and that there are a
<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
great many others, who, in the words of M.&nbsp;La Motte<a class = "tag"

AN ANSWER TO THE OBJECTION, THAT ONE CANNOT TRUST A MAN THAT GETS
DRUNK.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">T</span>here</span> is a proverb amongst the Jews. “<a
class = "tag" name = "tag23_1" id = "tag23_1" href =
"#note23_1">1</a><i>Ingrediente vino egreditur secretum.</i>” As the
wine goes in so the secret goes out. Seneca<a class = "tag" name =
"tag23_2" id = "tag23_2" href = "#note23_2">2</a> makes the same
objection. “As,” says he, “new wine bursts the vessel, and the heat
makes every
<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
thing go upwards, so the force of wine is such, that it brings to light,
and discovers, what is most secret and hidden.”</p>

<p>In answer to this objection I say, that people who are naturally
secret, are not less so after drinking. “<a class = "tag" name =
"tag23_3" id = "tag23_3" href = "#note23_3">3</a>And Bacchus was not
said to be the inventor of wine, on account of the liberty of his
tongue, but because he freed our minds from disquiet, and makes them
more firm and resolute in what we undertake.”</p>

<p>Besides, do we not see every day, people of all ranks, conditions,
and characters, get drunk, and yet we trust them with secrets, and it
very rarely happens they speak of them when they are drunk. Thus, if we
consult history, we shall learn from Seneca<a class = "tag" name =
"tag23_4" id = "tag23_4" href = "#note23_4">4</a> himself, that the
design of killing Cæsar was as well communicated to Tullius Cimber, who
was a great drinker, as to C.&nbsp;Cassius, who drank nothing but water.
And though L.&nbsp;Piso, governor of Rome, got frequently drunk, he,
notwithstanding, excellently acquitted himself of his duty. Augustus
made
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
no manner of difficulty to give him secret instructions, bestowing on
him the government of Thrace, the conquest of which he entirely
completed. Tiberius, before he left Rome, where he was generally hated,
in order to retire into the Campania, made choice of Costus, who was
extremely given to wine, for governor of that city, to whom he
communicated such things as he dared not trust his own ministers
with.</p>

<span class = "subhead">
AN ANSWER TO THE OBJECTION, THAT DRUNKENNESS MAKES ONE INCAPABLE OF
PERFORMING THE DUTIES OF CIVIL LIFE.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class = "firstletter">I</span>
deny</span> this absolutely, and to prove the contrary, I&nbsp;say, the
Persians had a custom to deliberate on things the most serious, and of
the
<span class = "pagenum">153</span>
greatest importance, after hard drinking. Tacitus reports the same thing
of the Germans. Dampier assures us, that the same custom is practised
with the inhabitants of the Isthmus Darien. And to go higher, one finds
in Homer, that during the siege of Troy, the Greeks, in council, did eat
and drink heartily. An evident proof, that this objection is contrary to
experience. But to go farther, this same experience made the ancients
look on those who could carry a great deal of wine, as persons of a
genius very much superior to those who could not drink at all. On this
account it was, that Cyrus, in writing to the Lacedemonians the reasons
which rendered him more capable of government than his brother, amongst
other things, takes notice, that he could drink more wine than he. And
so many fine productions, for which we are obliged to the drunkenness of
the poets, make it evidently appear, that wine, far from rendering us
incapable of doing any thing that is good, rather helps and incites us
to it. This important truth we shall confirm by several examples.</p>

<p>Plutarch relates, that Philip king of Macedon, after having conquered
the Athenians, made a
<span class = "pagenum">154</span>
feast, at which he got drunk; and that all proud with that happy
success, he nevertheless did a great many things entirely ridiculous;
but being informed that the ambassadors that the Athenians sent to him
to desire peace, wished to see him, he changed his countenance all of a
sudden, and having heard their proposals with all possible attention,
answered them with a great deal of justice.</p>

<p>The emperor Bonosus, who Amelian said was born not to live, but to
drink, acted always with greater prudence after drinking, says Flavius
Vopiscus, after Onesimus<a class = "tag" name = "tag24_1" id = "tag24_1"
href = "#note24_1">1</a>.</p>

<p>We have taken notice, in the foregoing chapter, that L.&nbsp;Piso,
governor of Rome, though he was often drunk, acquitted himself,
notwithstanding, punctually of his duty.</p>

<p>Christiern<a class = "tag" name = "tag24_2" id = "tag24_2" href =
"#note24_2">2</a>, the fourth king of Denmark, drank like a templer, and
never king was more laborious, a&nbsp;greater lover of his subjects, or
more beloved by them.</p>

<p>Scaliger<a class = "tag" name = "tag24_3" id = "tag24_3" href =
"#note24_3">3</a> says, that a German has as much
<span class = "pagenum">155</span>
reason when he is drunk, as when he has drank nothing. <i>Non minus
sapit Germanus ebrius quam sobrius.</i></p>

<p>Montaigne<a class = "tag" name = "tag24_4" id = "tag24_4" href =
"#note24_4">4</a> speaks in his Essays, of a great lord of his time,
who, though he drank every day a prodigious quantity of wine, was,
nevertheless, equally careful in his affairs. According to which, that
which Cicero says is not generally true, viz. “That one must never
expect prudence from a man that is always drunk.” <i>Nec enim ab homine
nunquam sobrio postulanda prudentia</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag24_5"
id = "tag24_5" href = "#note24_5">5</a>.</p>

<p>Another proof that drunkenness does not render us incapable of doing
any thing that is good, is, that it inspires people with courage, and
even makes the coward valiant. <i>Ad prelia trudit inertem.</i>
Experience confirms this truth. “We see,” says Montaigne<a class = "tag"
name = "tag24_6" id = "tag24_6" href = "#note24_6">6</a>, “that our
Germans, though drowned in wine, remember their post, the word, and
their rank.”</p>

<p>We read in Spartien, that a certain general
<span class = "pagenum">156</span>
having been vanquished by the Saracens, his soldiers laid all the blame
of their defeat on their want of wine.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the army of Pescennius Niger pressed earnestly for
wine, undoubtedly to make them fight the better; but he refused them in
these words, “You have the Nile,” said he, “and do you ask for wine?” In
imitation, I&nbsp;suppose, of the emperor Augustus<a class = "tag" name
= "tag24_7" id = "tag24_7" href = "#note24_7">7</a>, who, when the
people complained of the dearness and scarcity of wine, said to them,
“My son-in-law, Agrippa, has preserved you from thirst, by the canals he
has made for you.”</p>

<p>By what has been said it plainly appears, that wine is so far from
hindering a man from performing the duties of life, that it rather
forwards him, and is an admirable ingredient in all states and
conditions, both of peace and war, which made Horace<a class = "tag"

the god of wine.</p>

<p>One should certainly be very much in the wrong to put in the number
of those who had an aversion to wine the duke of Clarence. His brother,
Edward the Fourth, prejudiced with the predictions of Merlin, as if they
foretold, that one day that duke should usurp the crown from his
children, resolved to put him to death, he only gave him the liberty to
choose what death he
<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
would die of. The duke being willing to die a merry death, chose to be
drowned in a butt of Malmsey. Not unlike him on whom this epigram was

<p>But let us come in earnest to those who have really had an antipathy
to wine. Herbelot<a class = "tag" name = "tag26_2" id = "tag26_2" href =
"#note26_2">2</a>, in his Bibliotheque Orientale, says, that there are
some Mussulmans so superstitious, that they will not call wine by its
true name, which is Schamr and Nedibh; and that there are some princes
amongst them that have forbidden the mentioning of it by express laws.
The reason of all this is, the prohibition of Mahomet to his followers,
which enjoins them not to drink wine. The occasion of which prohibition
is as follows: “<a class = "tag" name = "tag26_3" id = "tag26_3" href =
"#note26_3">3</a>They say, that passing one day through a village,
<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
and seeing the people in the mirth of wine embracing and kissing one
another, and making a thousand protestations of friendship, he was so
charmed with the sight, that he blessed the wine, as the best thing in
the world. But that, at his return, observing the same place full of
blood, and having been informed, that the same men whom he had seen
before so merry, had, at last, changed their mirth into rage, and been
fighting with their swords, he recalled his benediction, and cursed wine
for ever, on account of the bad effects it produced.”</p>

<p>It is one of the chief commandments amongst the Siameze, to drink no
wine, nor any liquor that will procure drunkenness<a class = "tag" name
= "tag26_4" id = "tag26_4" href = "#note26_4">4</a>.</p>

<p>“<a class = "tag" name = "tag26_5" id = "tag26_5" href =

It is looked upon there as infamous. The greatest affront you can give a

any other name he will suffer very patiently, and without any right of
complaint of being injured in his reputation, as rogue, hang-dog, b<span

<p>Empedocles, we may well conclude, loved wine, which he called, Water
putrified in wood.</p>

RIGOROUS LAWS AGAINST WINE AND DRUNKENNESS.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =

not love wine themselves, would make very rigorous laws against
drunkenness, and fall into that fault which Horace speaks&nbsp;of.</p>

<p class = "verse">

<span class = "pagenum">165</span>
<p>But this maxim, <i>Nullum violentum durabile</i>, has been verified a
great many times, upon this subject of drunkenness, for all the laws
made against it have not long subsisted.</p>

<p>Pentheus<a class = "tag" name = "tag27_1" id = "tag27_1" href =
"#note27_1">1</a>, king of Thebes, endeavoured to extirpate entirely the
custom of getting drunk; but he did not find his account in it, for he
was very ill-treated by his subjects for his pains.</p>

<p>Lycurgus<a class = "tag" name = "tag27_2" id = "tag27_2" href =
"#note27_2">2</a>, king of Thrace, commanded all the vines of the
country to be cut up; for which he was justly punished by Bacchus. He
also made laws against drunkenness, which one may reckon amongst the bad
ones that he instituted.&nbsp;As,</p>

<p class = "inset">
I. <i>The using women in common.</i></p>

<p class = "inset">
II. <i>The nudity of young women in certain solemn festivals.</i></p>

<p>“Pittacus<a class = "tag" name = "tag27_3" id = "tag27_3" href =
"#note27_3">3</a>, one of the wise men of Greece, commanded, that he who
committed a fault when he was drunk, should suffer a double
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
punishment. And amongst the laws of Solon, there was one, which
condemned to death the chief magistrate if he got drunk. Amongst the
Indians, who only just touch wine in the ceremonies of their sacrifices,
the law commands, that the woman who killed one of their kings, should
get drunk, and marry his successor.”</p>

<p><a class = "tag" name = "tag27_4" id = "tag27_4" href =
"#note27_4">4</a>The Athenians had also very severe laws against those
that should get drunk; but one may say, these laws resembled those of
Draco, which were written rather with blood than ink.</p>

<p>We come now to the Turks. Sir Paul Ricaut<a class = "tag" name =
"tag27_5" id = "tag27_5" href = "#note27_5">5</a> tells us several
particulars on this head. Amurath, says he, resolved, in the year 1634,
to forbid entirely the use of wine. He put out a severe edict, which
commanded all the houses where they sold wine to be razed, the barrels
wherever they should be found to be staved, and the wine to be let out
into the streets. And that he might truly be satisfied his orders were
obeyed, he frequently disguised himself, and walked
<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
in that manner about the city; and when he found any one carrying wine,
he sent him to prison, and had him bastinadoed almost to death. One day
he met in the streets a poor deaf man, who not hearing the noise usually
made at the approach of the sultan, did not soon enough avoid a prince
whose presence was so fatal. This negligence cost him his life. He was
strangled by order of the grand seignior, who commanded his body to be
cast into the street. But this great severity did not last long, and all
things returned to their former condition.</p>

<p>However, matters took again another turn under the reign of Mahomet
the IVth. who, in 1670, resolved to forbid all the soldiery the use of
wine. The terrible seditions that liquor had formerly raised were
remembered, and especially that which happened under Mahomet the Third,
who saw his seraglio forced by a great multitude of soldiers full of
wine, and whose fury he could not free himself from, but by sacrificing
his principal favourites. An edict was published, to prohibit entirely
the use of wine, and to command all those who had any in their houses,
to send it out of town. The same extended all over the empire.
<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
The sultan condemned to death those who should violate this decree, in
which he spoke of wine as of a liquor infernal, invented by the devil to
destroy the souls of men, to disturb their reason, and put states into
combustion. This was rigorously put in execution, and to that extremity,
that it cost the ambassador of England, and the christian merchants of
Constantinople, great solicitations, and large sums of money, to get
leave to make only as much wine as would suffice for their own families.
At Smyrna, the officers of the grand seignior had not the same
indulgence for the christians, who were one whole year without wine; and
it was with great difficulty they got leave to import it from the isles
of the Archipelago, and other places not comprised in that prohibition;
for this prohibition reached only those places where there were mosques.
Besides all this, they made every Friday sermons stuffed full of
declamations against those who should drink it. In short, this edict was
so severe, that wine seemed to be banished for ever the states of the
grand seignior. But in about a year’s time its severity was somewhat
remitted. The ambassadors, and other christians, had leave
<span class = "pagenum">169</span>
to make wine within themselves; and about a year after that, the
indulgence for wine was general, the taverns were opened, and at this

RULES TO BE OBSERVED IN GETTING DRUNK. I.&nbsp;NOT TOO OFTEN. II. IN
GOOD COMPANY.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">T</span>o</span> avoid the disorders that drunkenness
might cause, here are some rules that ought to be observed in this
important affair of getting drunk; for, according to Pliny, the art of
getting drunk has its laws.</p>

<p class = "verse">
Hæc ars suis legibus constat.<a class = "tag" name = "tag28_a" id =
"tag28_a" href = "#note28_a">a</a></p>

<p>I. The first, and principal of these, is not to
<span class = "pagenum">170</span>
get drunk too often. This is what Seneca<a class = "tag" name =
"tag28_1" id = "tag28_1" href = "#note28_1">1</a> recommends very much.
“You must not,” says he, “do it often, for fear it grow into a habit; it
is but only sometimes you should make your spirits gay in banishing
gloomy sobriety.”</p>

<p>And if any person objects, That if one gets drunk sometimes, one
shall do it often. I&nbsp;deny the consequence, and say in the words of
the philosopher, an axiom held by both universities, that</p>

<p class = "verse">
Ab actu ad habitum non valet consequentia.</p>

<p>II. Second rule. One must not get drunk but in good company. That is
to say, with good friends, people of wit, honour, and good humour, and
where there is good wine. For example, a&nbsp;man in former times would
have done very ill to get drunk with Heliogabalus, whose historian<a
class = "tag" name = "tag28_2" id = "tag28_2" href = "#note28_2">2</a>
reports, that after having made his friends drunk, he used to shut them
up in an apartment, and at night let loose upon them lions, leopards,
and tigers, which always tore to pieces
<span class = "pagenum">171</span>
some of them. On the other hand, the best wine in the world will taste
very bad in bad company. It is therefore that Martial reproaches one,
that he spoiled his good wine with his silly babbling.</p>

<span class = "subhead">
THIRD RULE, WITH GOOD WINE.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =
"firstletter">W</span>hen</span> one has a mind to get drunk, one should
make choice of good wine, and not drink bad, which is prejudicial to
health. For example, green wine is very bad; this Guilleaume Cretin<a
class = "tag" name = "tag29_1" id = "tag29_1" href = "#note29_1">1</a>,
a&nbsp;great punster, has expressed in these
<span class = "pagenum">172</span>
verses, which, I&nbsp;own, I&nbsp;am not able to put into
English:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Par ce vin verds Atropos a trop os</p>
<p>Des corps humains ruez envers en vers</p>
<p>Dont un quidam apre aux pots a propos</p>
<p>A fort blâmé les tours pervers en vers.”</p>
</div>

<p>Good wine, on the contrary, has very good effects. Erasmus<a class =
"tag" name = "tag29_2" id = "tag29_2" href = "#note29_2">2</a> preserved
himself from the plague, by drinking a glass of Burgundy at a proper
season.</p>

<p>You see now the efficacy of good wine, which, to be in its
perfection, the adepts in the free-schools of Liber Pater say, must have
these four properties, and please these four senses:&mdash; the taste by
its savour, the smell by its flavour, the sight by its clean and bright
colour, and the ear by the fame of the country where it grows. Old wine
was looked upon to be the best by the ancients.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>A beauty, when advanc’d in age,</p>
<p>No more her lovers can engage;</p>
<p>But wine, the rare advantage, knows,</p>
<p>It pleases more, more old it grows.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<p>And were they never so old themselves, they would still, if possible,
have the wine older than they were. <i>Nec cuiquam adeo longa erat vita,
ut non ante se genita potaret</i><a class = "tag" name = "tag29_3" id =
"tag29_3" href = "#note29_3">3</a>. Which these words of Seneca<a class

confirm, “Why at your house do you drink wine older than yourself?
<i>Cur apud te vinum apud te vetustius bibitur.</i>”</p>

<p>Martial says, “Do you ask me of what consulate this wine is? It was
before there were any consuls in the world.</p>

<p>At present the fame of the best wine in Europe is reckoned to be,
that of Monte Fiascone, two days journey from Rome. Here it was a German
abbot killed himself by drinking too much of this delicious creature.
The story is this, and it is related in Lassell’s Travels:&mdash;</p>

<p>A certain German abbot, travelling to Rome, ordered his servant to
ride before him, and when he found the best wine, to chalk upon the door
of
<span class = "pagenum">174</span>
the inn (in&nbsp;order to save time) the word <i>EST</i>. Coming to
Monte Fiascone, he found it so excellent, that he put down, <i>Est, Est,
Est</i>, which the abbot finding true, drank so plentifully of it, that
he went no farther on his journey, but lies buried, they say, in the
cathedral church, with this epitaph, written by his servant the
purveyor.</p>

<p class = "center">
Est, Est, Est,<br>
et<br>
Propter nimium Est,<br>
Herus meus Dominus Abbas<br>
mortuus Est.</p>

<p>The wine called Lachrymæ Christi, or the Tears of Christ, is a most
delicious wine.&nbsp;At least a master of arts of the university of
Cologn thought so, who going also to Rome, drank at the same place
pretty heartily of it, and out of the abundance of his heart cried
out,</p>

<p class = "verse">
Utinam Christus lachrymatus fuisset in nostra patria.</p>

<p class = "verse trans">
I wish Christ had shed tears in our country.</p>

<p>M. Hofman believes, that Rhenish wine is the best of all wines for
one’s health.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">175</span>
<p>There <ins class = "notation" title = "text unchanged">grows</ins>
also most excellent <ins class = "notation" title = "text unchanged">wines</ins> in France, such as Champagne.</p>

<p>Wenceslaus<a class = "tag" name = "tag29_5" id = "tag29_5" href =
"#note29_5">5</a>, king of Bohemia and the Romans, being come into
France on account of some negociations with Charles the Sixth, arrived
at Rheins in the month of March, 1397. When he was in that city he found
the wine so good, that he got drunk more than once; and being one day in
that condition, that he could not enter into any serious discourses, he
rather chose to grant what was asked of him than leave off drinking.</p>

<p>The wines of Burgundy must not be forgotten, which some prefer to
Champagne. “Baudius called vin de beaulne, vinum deorum, the wine of the
gods<a class = "tag" name = "tag29_6" id = "tag29_6" href =
"#note29_6">6</a>.”</p>

<p>The wines of Ai are also very excellent. S.&nbsp;Evremont<a class =
"tag" name = "tag29_7" id = "tag29_7" href = "#note29_7">7</a> says,
that Leo the Tenth, Charles the Fifth, Francis the First, and Hen. VIII.
king of England, did not think it below their dignity, amongst the most
important affairs of
<span class = "pagenum">176</span>
state, to take care to have the wines of Ai. Henry IV. caused himself to
be styled lord of Ai and Gonesse.</p>

<p>But I shall desire my readers here to observe two things, First, That
artificial wines, and a many other liquors, containing a great deal of
gross, viscous matter, excite a drunkenness more long and dangerous than
that which is produced by ordinary wines. Another thing is, Never to get
drunk with brandy, spirits, and strong waters. Patin<a class = "tag"
name = "tag29_8" id = "tag29_8" href = "#note29_8">8</a> says very
pleasantly, that these are sugared poisons which surely kill: they give
life to those who sell them, and death to those who use them.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =

<p>And when a man puts on the air of a philosopher, it is then he turns
fool in affecting to be wise.</p>

<p>There is a time for all things, and so there is in getting drunk,
that is, getting drunk with decency and decorum; and there are some
times which are not convenient to do so. As for example, (for I love to
illustrate what I advance,) it does not suit with decorum for a judge to
be drunk on the bench; nor a crier in the court exercising his office,
[hiccup, ki<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> book;]
a&nbsp;parson
<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
in the pulpit; an experimental philosopher in shewing of his gimcracks;
nor a freemason on the top of a church-steeple.</p>

<p>But it suits very well with strict decorum, to get drunk at a public
rejoicing after a signal victory.</p>

<p>However rigorous the Roman laws were against drunkenness, they
permitted it nevertheless on their festivals; witness what a young man
said to his father in presence of the people. “<a class = "tag" name =
"tag30_2" id = "tag30_2" href = "#note30_2">2</a>No father,” says he,
“I&nbsp;have no reason to be ashamed for having taken a little more wine
than ordinary at a feast with my companions.” <i>Non est res qua
embescam, Pater, si die festo inter æquales largiore vino fui
usus.</i></p>

<p>The Persian soldiers, who otherwise lived
<span class = "pagenum">180</span>
very soberly, were permitted to get drunk once a year<a class = "tag"
name = "tag30_3" id = "tag30_3" href = "#note30_3">3</a>.</p>

<p>In Georgia, he who did not get quite drunk at their principal
holidays, as at Easter and Christmas, was not looked upon to be a
christian, and ought to be excommunicated. <a class = "tag" name =
"tag30_4" id = "tag30_4" href = "#note30_4">4</a>So that, according to
this, getting drunk at certain convenient times amongst these
christians, was so far from being unlawful, that a man was not looked
upon to be orthodox, without he did so. Getting drunk is therefore very
orthodox.</p>

FIFTH RULE, TO FORCE NO ONE TO DRINK.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =

force any one to drink, because the taking away liberty spoils company,
the benefit of which cannot subsist without freedom. Besides, every
man’s capacity of drinking is not the same; one shall be able to drink a
gallon, and another a pint; the latter, therefore, by drinking a pint,
has drank as much as the former when he has taken off his gallon,
because they both have drank as they can, and <span class =

<p>We learn from history, that there was an ancient law amongst the
Persians, that forbad anyone to force another to drink. The
Lacedemonians also had that laudable custom.</p>

<p>Charlemagne also made a law, that prohibited forcing any one to
drink.</p>

<p>Mr. Bayle reports a very pleasant revenge that M.&nbsp;Peyren gave to
Raphael Thorius, a&nbsp;very learned person, who would force him to
drink, which take as follows. “<a class = "tag" name = "tag31_1" id =
"tag31_1" href = "#note31_1">1</a>M.&nbsp;Peyren dining at London with
several persons of learning, could not be discharged from drinking a
health that Dr. Thorius toasted. The glass was of a prodigious size,
which M.&nbsp;Peyren, for that reason, a&nbsp;long while refused, and
alleged a thousand reasons, but all in vain; he must empty the glass.
Before he did it he made this agreement with his antagonist, that he
should drink a health afterwards that he should toast to him; which
being consented to, he took off the bumper, and filled the glass full of
water, and drank it off to the
<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
doctor, who thereupon was thunderstruck, but seeing he could not get
off, sighed deeply, and lifted the glass a thousand times to his lips,
and as often drew it back again: he called to his assistance all the
quaint sayings of the Greek and Latin poets, and was almost the whole
day drinking that cursed bumper.”</p>

<p>This is not much unlike what M. Chevreau reports of Marigni, who, “<a
class = "tag" name = "tag31_2" id = "tag31_2" href =
"#note31_2">2</a>after having dined at one of the best eating-houses in
Frankfort, with six or seven persons of quality, was called to the
sideboard, where one of them began the emperor’s health. This he must
drink, and as he foresaw very well, that this extravagance would be
attended with others, he ordered three or four great pieces of bread to
be brought to him, and having eaten half of one to the health of the
king of France, he gave the other half to the other, who took it,
indeed, but would not so much as put it to his mouth. The company
surprized at so unexpected a novelty, let him alone without any
contradiction.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, one should be very diligent in
<span class = "pagenum">184</span>
observing this rule, which is, That when we find ourselves in the
company of people that drink, and would not run those lengths they are
going to do, to retire; and this was a standing law amongst the Greeks
in their festivals, and ought to be as unalterable as the laws of the
Medes and Persians, viz.</p>

SIXTH RULE, NOT TO PUSH DRUNKENNESS TOO FAR.</span></h3>

<p><span class = "firstword"><span class =

continually to have an eye to this maxim of Horace, viz. <i>Est modus in
rebus</i>. And the <i>Ne quid nimis</i> of Terence; but especially, in
this grand and most important affair of drunkenness.
<span class = "pagenum">185</span>
Seneca very well distinguishes two sorts of drunkenness, one which
entirely <i>buries</i> our reason; and the other, which only
<i>diverts</i> melancholy and chagrin. The last we believe to be very
lawful; but we would have it go farther, even so far, as not only <i>to
divert</i>, but to <i>drive away</i> our cares entirely, or else not to
get drunk at all. That which is between these, if any such there can be,
does one an injury, according to the poet:&mdash;</p>

<p>After this manner would we have people use the juice of the grape;

them, but which take as follow.</p>

<p>First and foremost, amongst your philosophers, you have taken no
notice of the stupendous Des Cartes, with his wonderful system of
whirlpools (vortices) and particles, cubic, conic, striate, oblong,
globular, hooked, crooked, spiral and angular: for who the devil but a
mere tipsy, giddy brains, could have dished up such a confounded

<p class = "space">
Thirdly and lastly, I wish in Chap. XXIII. in your answer to the
objection, “That one cannot trust a man that gets drunk,” you had been
pleased to have taken notice of the taciturnity and continency of the
right worshipful the free masons in this respect. For though otherwise
they are <i>free</i> enough of speech, yet I do assure you, as to
secrets, though some of them love the creature very heartily, and
carouse abundantly, yet has it never been known, though never so
fuddled, (for free masons will get fuddled,) that they
<span class = "pagenum">205</span>
ever discovered any of their secrets. This is irresistible,
irrefragable, irrefutable, or if you will, to speak (<i>norunt
dialectici</i>) <i>in stylo infinito</i>, non-resistible,
non-refragable, and non-refutable, and, indeed, is my <i>Argumentum
palmare Scotisticum</i>.</p>

<p>But, and Fourthly also, and Finally, you will give me leave to remark
to you, That in relation to St. Boniface’s cup, which you take notice of
in Chap. XI. p.&nbsp;68, l. 13, I&nbsp;do assure you, sir, the practice
was some years ago, to my certain knowledge, much in vogue, (and, as I
am credibly informed, is still wonderfully catholic,) and, by the bye,
take the following relation.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the last wars, when I was very young, I&nbsp;had
the misfortune to be prisoner in Luxembourg, and not too civilly treated
by the governor, the morose Count Dautel. Close confinement, (though in
the postmaster’s house,) with the unusual smell of the stoves, (for it
was in the cold month of March,) made me very ill, and worse, in all
probability, should have been, had I not obtained the liberty of the
town, which, after many fruitless solicitations, I&nbsp;despaired, from
the ill-natured governor, nor should ever have had,
<span class = "pagenum">206</span>
were it not by the pressing instance of Father Cripps, a&nbsp;German
Franciscan friar, of the convent of Luxembourg, whom they called there
Heer<a class = "tag" name = "tagTP_1" id = "tagTP_1" href =
"#noteTP_1">1</a> Cripps, being confessor to the governor, and having
been once sent on a message of moment from him to the king of Spain,
Philip the Fifth, now reigning.</p>

<p>This Father was really a good man, and a man of honour; him I gained
by the good-nature of the postmaster, whose son was then in his
noviceship, in the noviciate of their Order at Ulflingen. I&nbsp;need
not tell you, that by noviceship is meant that year of probation, which
those who have a mind to enter into any religious order in the church of
Rome, must pass through, before they can be professed, or take their
vows. This you, who have been abroad, must know as well as&nbsp;I.</p>

<p>This good father, with much ado, obtained what I desired from the
governor, who he said was, <i>homo mirabilis in negotiis suis</i>,
which, by the
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
sequel of his discourse, I&nbsp;understood signified, a&nbsp;very
strange man in his affairs. Gratitude obliged me to invite this reverend
father to a glass of Rhenish, the wine of the country, which, he frankly
accepted of in the afternoon, and, indeed, drank very plentifully, more
Germanorum, as you have described. But though he would drink largely as
well as his companion, yet I must own, that in none of the many merry
bouts we had together (for he visited me very often afterwards, as I did
him, I&nbsp;never saw him so far advanced as to lose his reason) he
never failed a large glass brimful to St. Boniface, which he drank to
the pious memory of the good Father, <i>ad piam memoriam boni
patris</i>, and sometimes only to the good Father, <i>ad bonum
patrem</i>. I found afterwards the same laudable custom of St.
Boniface’s cup in the Low Countries, France and Italy, &amp;c. amongst
the religious.</p>

<p>And now, before I subscribe myself,</p>

<div class = "rightside">
<p class = "center">Sir,</p>

<p class = "center">Your most obedient, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>give me leave to tell you, that the French religious, who do not
speak much Latin, drink healths in their own language. But I was
surprised,
<span class = "pagenum">208</span>
when I heard in a certain monastery every one of the fathers drink a
full glass to each other in these words, “a&nbsp;bumper,” as I thought.
I&nbsp;am obliged to your reverence (reverend father, said I to the
procurator, who sat next me, and drank to me in the same words) in
drinking in our country language, you do me a great deal of honour. It
may be your country phrase, said the prior to me, very gravely, for what
I know; your countrymen make use of a great many of our words, but the
thing itself, let the word (or&nbsp;<i>vox significans</i>) be what it
will, the thing (or&nbsp;<i>res significata</i>) is very laudable, and
every one will practise, who has any respect for the sacred see, holy
church, and the good of his own soul. Did you never hear of the
indulgences that the good father, holy pope St. Boniface, has granted to
such as drink his cup, and which we have just now piously done?
I&nbsp;ask your reverence’s pardon, reverend father, said&nbsp;I,
I&nbsp;thought we had only been drinking a bumper to one another.
<i>Seulement au bon pere</i>! replied he a little warmly (for the
conversation was all in French, and which word I till then mistook for a
bumper.) Why, that is all, said he, <i>mais</i> (continued

The transition from <i>au bon pere</i>, which is pure French, to a

<h4>Transcriber’s Notes</h4>

<h5><a name = "endnote" id = "endnote">About the Book</a></h5>

<p>The <i>Encomium Ebrietatis</i> was originally published in 1714 as
“Eloge de l’Yvresse” by Albert-Henri de Sallengre, and translated in
1723 by Robert Samber with the present title. The 1812 edition updates
the spelling and punctuation, and omits part of the title page (below),
but is otherwise the same text.</p>

<!-- original edition (1910 rpt of 1723) TIA http:
//www.archive.org/details/ebrietatisencomi00sall -->

<p>Title page of 1723 edition from 1910 reprint (the word “facsimile” is
used loosely):</p>

<p class = "center">
<img src = "images/title_fac.png" width = "283" height = "576"
alt = "see title page"></p>

<p>Paragraph omitted from 1812 title page:</p>

<p class = "inset">
Confirmed by the example of heathens, Turks, infidels, primitive
Christians, saints, popes, bishops, doctors, philosophers, poets, free
masons, and other men of learning in all ages</p>

<h5>Spelling of Names</h5>

<p>Variant spellings have generally not been noted. Common patterns
include:</p>

<p class = "inset">
Final “e” omitted: Jerom, Augustin<br>
Simple “e” for “ae” or “æ”: Lacedemonia, Cecilius, Megera, Eschylus<br>
French forms: Gascogn, Trimalchion</p>

<h5>Additional Footnote</h5>

<p><a name = "endnoteA" id = "endnoteA" href = "#endtagA">A.</a>
Greek quotation as printed (errors in <b>boldface</b>):</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "indent2">φεύ τ<b>ί</b>νες <b>ὔ</b>δωρ</p>

<p class = "indent2">pheu tines <b>u</b>dôr</p>

<p>Some errors apply only to accentuation. The 1723 edition, or its
reprint, has far more errors.</p>
